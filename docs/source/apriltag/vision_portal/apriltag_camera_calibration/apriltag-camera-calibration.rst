AprilTag Camera Calibration
===========================

To provide good pose estimates, **each RC phone camera or webcam model**
requires calibration data, for **each specific resolution**.

   *“Without a camera calibration, the best you could achieve is being
   able to turn towards the target. Range information would be
   incorrect.” – FTC navigation expert @gearsincorg*

The FTC SDK contains such data for a limited number of webcams and
resolutions. Teams can generate their own data, called **lens
intrinsics**.

Here’s one possible procedure, of several free choices available
publicly.

Utility OpMode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, create an OpMode from the Java Sample
``UtilityCameraFrameCapture.java``. Android Studio teams can find this
utility program in the External Samples folder.

FTC Blocks teams can duplicate this OpMode, requiring a custom myBlock
only for the method ``saveNextFrameRaw()``. At some future time, this
Java method may become available as a regular Block, avoiding the need
for a myBlock. Learn more about myBlocks here:

- `MyBlocks Tutorial <https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/index.html>`__.

This Utility OpMode helps calibrate a webcam or RC phone camera, needed
for AprilTag pose estimation. It captures a camera frame (image) and
stores it on the Robot Controller (Control Hub or RC phone), with each
press of the gamepad button X (or Square).

To illustrate, the OpMode stores the first two captured images as: 

- ``VisionPortal-CameraFrameCapture-000000.png`` 
- ``VisionPortal-CameraFrameCapture-000001.png``

This is done for each run of the OpMode. Teams should move each set of
frames to its own folder (on a computer), to avoid overwriting the
previous run’s results.

Mac OSX users may need special software for Android file transfer.

Next, read and follow the calibration instructions posted at
`ftc-docs <https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/camera-calibration>`__.
Other calibration programs are widely available online.

Existing Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running ``ConceptDoubleVision`` (or any AprilTag Sample OpModes) using a
built-in RC phone camera, gives the following error message on both
devices:

.. figure:: images/010-RC-warning.png
   :width: 75%
   :align: center
   :alt: Camera Calibration Warning

   Warning of no camera calibration provided

|

.. figure:: images/020-DS-warning.png
   :width: 75%
   :align: center
   :alt: Detections with warning

   Right-hand image shows that the warning still allows detections.

The SDK gives a different warning that covers a **special case**, where
the OpMode uses: 

- a camera model for which the SDK **does have** lens intrinsics, and 
- a user-specified resolution for which 

  - (a) the SDK **does not have** lens intrinsics, and 
  - (b) the **aspect ratio** matches that of lens intrinsics that the SDK
    **does have** (for that camera model).

In such a case, the SDK **scales** the results in an attempt to estimate
AprilTag pose.

For example, changing the Logitech C270 resolution from 640x480 to
800x600 (also 4:3 aspect ratio), gives this warning on the RC preview
and the DS screen:

.. figure:: images/030-scaling-warning.png
   :width: 75%
   :align: center
   :alt: Resolution Warning

   Warning about no calibration at this resolution

The above warning advises the user of this situation, with the
opportunity to accept/adjust the scaled estimate or provide actual
calibration values.

This warning does not affect the function of capturing and storing
camera frames.

SDK Calibration Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Logitech C270 webcam offers 18 resolutions, each wanting
calibration. The Logitech C920 offers 19 resolutions.

For the “FTC standard” Logitech C270 (from the FIRST Storefront), the
FTC SDK 8.2 currently has a set of lens intrinsics for **one
resolution**, 640x480.

Currently the FTC SDK has calibration data for 10 resolutions spread
among 4 webcams:

-  Logitech HD Webcam C270, 640x480
-  Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920, 640x480, 800x600, 640x360, 1920x1080,
   800x448, 864x480
-  Logitech HD Webcam C310, 640x480, 640x360
-  Microsoft Lifecam HD 3000 v1/v2, 640x480

These are found in the SDK file ``builtinwebcamcalibrations.xml``. In
Android Studio, navigate to the subfolders ``RobotCore``, ``res``,
``xml``.

Android RC phone cameras also need calibration data for good pose
estimates. The FTC SDK provides no lens intrinsics for these cameras.
