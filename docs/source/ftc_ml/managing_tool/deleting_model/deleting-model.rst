When the user clicks Delete Models, the system determines whether the
selected models can be deleted. Models that have been used as a starting
point for more training cannot be deleted until after the other model is
deleted.

A confirmation dialog is shown after the delete button has been pressed.
If the users clicks Yes, the selected models will be deleted. If the
selected models cannot be deleted, a dialog explaining why is shown:
