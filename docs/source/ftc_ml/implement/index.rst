Implementing in Robot Code
============================

The basis of this tutorial will be the sample opmodes provided by *FIRST*
in the `9.0 SDK <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController>`__. The
process for testing a custom TensorFlow model is quite simple. To do
this the general process flow is as follows:

1. Use ftc-ml to build your custom TensorFlow model.

2. Create a new OpMode based on an appropriate sample OpMode.

3. Make relatively small changes to the new OpMode.

4. Add your model (.tflite file)
