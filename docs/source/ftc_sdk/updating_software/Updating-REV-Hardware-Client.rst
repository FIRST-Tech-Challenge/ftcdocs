Installing and Updating the REV Hardware Client
===============================================

The REV Hardware Client is a desktop app, or software tool, that simplifies
updating software on devices used in *FIRST* Tech Challenge. Unfortunately the
REV Hardware Client is currently Windows-only, Apple/Mac users must use
alternate methods of updating software. In this tutorial, some steps ask to
download software and updates - doing this is not required, but will save time
during updates. 

To install, use the following steps on a **64-bit** PC or laptop running
Windows 7 or newer.

**Apple/Mac users should skip these steps.**

.. tip:: 
   Not sure about 64-bit? In Windows Explorer, right-click “Computer” (Win
   7) or “This PC” (Win 10), choose Properties, see “System type”.

Installing the RHC
------------------

1. Connect the computer to the internet, and download RHC
   `from the REV RHC download page <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__. Just
   click the orange Download button and choose your computer’s Downloads
   folder to store the file.

2. See the downloaded file shown at lower left (green arrow). Click that
   filename to begin installing the RHC app; then follow the prompts.
   When that’s complete, the RHC icon will appear on your computer’s
   desktop.

   If the computer is **not** 64-bit, RHC installation will fail with an
   appropriate error message.

Downloading Initial Updates
---------------------------

Open the RHC app. This is a good time to **pre-download** various
pieces of software you might need soon.

Why download now? Later, this computer might be connected via Wi-Fi to a
Robot Controller, not to the internet. Or a good internet connection
might not be available when urgently needed (Murphy’s Law).

Click on the Downloads tab (top left). Under “Available Files” is a list
of software for *FIRST* Tech Challenge and other software for a different program called
*FIRST* Robotics Competition.

   REV Hardware Client Available Files

|

Click the orange Download button, only for the 5 *FIRST* Tech Challenge items (yellow
rectangles). This may take a few minutes; the OS files are large.

You don’t need to track where these files are stored; they will be
available to the RHC app when needed for device update.

When complete, these 5 items will appear under the heading “Downloaded
Files”.

Updating the REV Hardware Client
--------------------------------

1. On a Windows computer connected to the internet, open the REV
   Hardware Client.

2. Click the "About" tab, then click "Check for Updates" (green arrow,
   above). If a new version is available, click to update.

That’s all for now! You will use these files later, when updating
various devices. More info about the RHC is
`at REV Robotics’ excellent documentation site. <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__
