FTC Color Processing - Introduction
===================================

Overview
--------

The *FIRST* Tech Challenge Software Development Kit will soon
include some Color Processing features from OpenCV, a popular and powerful
open-source library for vision processing.

Introduced for *INTO THE DEEP*, these new features will help FTC teams identify
colors and process color blobs, useful in any game requiring color and shape
recognition.

The full contents of this documentation will be released soon, along with version 10.1 of the FTC SDK.
