Connecting Devices To a Control or Expansion Hub
================================================

This section explains how to connect a motor, a servo, and some sensors
to your REV Robotics Control Hub or REV Robotics Expansion Hub. While
the Control Hub differs from the Expansion Hub because of its built in
Android device, the layout of the external motor, servo, and sensor
ports are identical for the Control Hub and Expansion Hub.

The images in this section use an Expansion Hub to demonstrate how to
connect the devices. The process, however, is identical for a Control
Hub.

When the instructions in this section use the word "Hub", they are
referring to a Control Hub or Expansion Hub.
