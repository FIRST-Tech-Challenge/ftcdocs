Connecting 12V Power to the Hub
================================

The Hub draws power from a 12V rechargeable battery. For safety reasons,
the battery has a 20A fuse built in. A mechanical switch is used to turn
on/turn off the power.

Note that it will take an estimated 5 minutes to complete this task.


Connecting 12V Power to the Hub Instructions
--------------------------------------------

1. If your 12V battery has a Tamiya style connector, connect the      
Tamiya to XT30 adapter cable to the matching end of the switch cable.

.. note:: Do not connect the 12V battery to the Tamiya adapter yet.  We will connect the battery during a later step.

2. Connect the other end of the switch cable to a matching XT30 port  
on the Hub.

5. Turn on the switch and verify that the Hub is drawing power from   
the battery. Note that the Hub's LED should be illuminated (notice    
the blue LED in upper right-hand corner of the Hub in the image       
below).
