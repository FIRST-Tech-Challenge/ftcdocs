FTC Docs aims to provide a comprehensive documentation base for *FIRST* Tech Challenge teams and mentors. 
It is a community-driven project, hosted and moderated by FIRST Tech Challenge staff, 
and we welcome contributions from all teams and mentors. It is our hope that this project will help to 
make the community more connected and informed while reducing the fragmentation of documentation present 
in *FIRST* Tech Challenge. The information provided is not meant to endorse any specific method or approach, 
but rather to provide a information base for students and mentors to make informed decisions.
