Driver Station Overview
=======================

These images represent a basic connection diagram for the components that have
typically been used to create a Driver Station - these components have
typically been purchased from the *FIRST* Storefront (in the "Control and
Communication" kit). These configurations show sample connections, and in no
way represent the only possible way of connecting these components. These
images also do not represent using a 
`Driver Station Carrier <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3386378>`_, 
which is recommended for teams to use for component management and
transportation. See rule ``DS07`` in 
:doc:`Game Manual 1 <../../manuals/game_manuals/game_manuals>` for more information 
on Driver Station Carriers.
