Robot Controller Overview
=========================

These images represent a basic connection diagram for the components that have
typically been included in a standard Robot Starter Kit plus the components
purchased from the *FIRST* Storefront (demonstrating components from the REV
and Tetrix starter kits, along with the Electronics kit). These configurations
show sample connections, and in no way represent the only possible way of
connecting these components.  In both diagrams is an extra optional REV
Expansion Hub that has NOT been included with standard starter kits nor
electronics kits; it is included in these diagrams as a sample of how to
connect an additional optional REV Expansion Hub if one is available and
desired.
