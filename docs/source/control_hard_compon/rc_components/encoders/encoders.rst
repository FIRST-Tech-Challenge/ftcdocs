      REV Through Bore Encoder, in incremental mode.

An encoder is a device that measures the roatational displacement around an
axis.  All legal *FIRST* Tech Challenge motors contain a built in quadrature
encoder that is compatible with a REV Hub. It is also possible to use a
standalone incremental encoder like a REV Through Bore Enocder (shown above).
An incremental encoder works by sending out a "tick" per partial rotation of
the shaft. More information on how many ticks are output per rotation can be
found on the manufacturer's website. An absolute encoder is able to indicate
the displacement of the shaft from its starting position and the the exact
angle the shaft is currently at relative to a "zero" position.
