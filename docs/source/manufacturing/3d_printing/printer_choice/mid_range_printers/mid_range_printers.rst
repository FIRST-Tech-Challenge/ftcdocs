Mid-Range Printers ($300-$600 USD)
==================================

Prusa Mini+ ($559)
-----------------

If you're ok with paying a premium and getting a smaller build volume in exchange for a printer that just works
every time, the Prusa Mini+ is a great option, as Prusa has had millions of hours running these machines. Just 
about every issue with this printer has been found, patched, and pushed to the consumer.

Prusa Mini+ Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Spring Steel Sheets
* Prusa's consistency guarantee
* Open Source Hardware
* Easily Transportable
* 180mm x 180mm x 180mm Print Volume

Prusa Mini+ Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Premium price

.. note:: You can now order Prusa printers from either their headquarters in Czechia or their subsidiary and sole authorized
          reseller **PrintedSolid**, based in Delaware. If you live in the USA and plan to order a Prusa printer, save 
          yourself the headache of customs and long shipping times and order from their USA subsidiary.
