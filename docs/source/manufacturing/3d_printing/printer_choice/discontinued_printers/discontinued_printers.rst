Discontinued 3D Printers
=============================

These are printers that were formerly recommended by FTCdocs but have been discontinued by the manufacturer.

However, they may still be found on the used market, but **don't pay too much for them**.

These last-generation printers may still be good options for teams on a budget (unless stated otherwise), but it is important to check if they have the features listed above and to be aware of any potential issues that may arise from buying a discontinued printer.

Software and firmware updates are less frequent for discontinued printers, so it is important to check if the manufacturer will continue to support the printer with updates and replacement parts.

Third-party parts may be available for some discontinued printers (on Aliexpress for example), but it is important to check the quality, safety, and reliability of these parts before purchasing.

Most of the prices and printer descriptions below are an archive copied from the time when they were still recommended, but some notes have been added to the descriptions to reflect the fact that they are now discontinued and to warn teams of any potential issues that may arise from buying a discontinued printer.

Prusa MK3S+ ($649-$899)
-----------------------

If you're looking to buy a printer that just works every time, the Prusa MK3S+ is amazing. Prusa has had millions 
of hours running these machines, and just about every issue with this printer has been found, patched, and pushed 
to the consumer. If it's any testament to their consistency, the 3D printed parts used on the Mk3s+ are printed 
mostly on Mk3s+ printers. This is Prusa's previous flagship printer and is more tested and cheaper than the Mk4, 
but if you are looking at Prusa make sure to explore the Mk4 as well due to it's more updated features. 

Mk3s+ Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Easy to Repair
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Spring Steel Sheets
* All-Metal Direct Drive Extruder
* 250mm x 210mm x 210mm Print Volume
* Unrivaled consistency as a workhorse

Mk3s+ Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Slow printing speed
* Dated technology (such as lack of WiFi)
* Last generation 3D printer, Mk4 improves on issues

Prusa MK4 ($799-$1099)
----------------------

This printer is for anyone interested in consistency with an improved featureset. The Prusa MK4 
is the successor to the MK3S+ with the same reliability and consistency hallmarks but adds newer 
features such as WiFi as well as being much faster and more user friendly. This machine is still 
in it's early stages of development and improvement as of 2023, and will surely make leaps and 
bounds in consistency, features, and software optimization as Prusa finds more issues and patches 
them.

Mk4 Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* High Speed (Nearing comparison to BambuLab printers)
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Spring Steel Sheets
* All-Metal Direct Drive Extruder with a planetary gearbox
* WiFi Printing capabilities and remote print monitoring
* 250mm x 210mm x 210mm Print Volume

Mk4 Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Cartesian kinematics make matching the speed of CoreXY printers difficult

Bambu Lab P1P ($599)
-------------------

Built for speed by Bambu Lab, the P1P is a CoreXY machine with well engineered proprietary hardware and software. 
A machine that is proving very reliable for many despite Bambu Lab's short time in the 3D printer marketplace so
far, the P1P is an amazing mid range option with a lot of manufacturing capability for it's cost. This printer is 
also compatible with Bambu Lab's multimaterial system, and can be upgraded to their new offering, the P1S, for just
150$ if your needs eventually outgrow the P1P. 

.. note:: This printer is a PLA workhorse, being able to print it about as fast and well as the Bambu Lab X1C at half the 
          price. Even if you have the budget for an X1C, it may be worth considering buying 2 P1Ps instead if you don't 
          need all the bells and whistles the X1C has and plan to only print PLA/PETG.

P1P Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Extremely fast CoreXY motion system
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Beds of All Surfaces
* All-Metal Direct Drive Extruder
* WiFi Printing capabilities and remote print monitoring
* 256mm x 256mm x 256mm Print Volume
* Automatic print failure detection

P1P Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Replacement parts are proprietary from Bambu Lab (albeit well-priced). Some third-party replacements are available, but for some components, you are reliant on Bambu Lab for replacements.
* Carbon Fiber rods can wear out over time
* Reliant on Bambu Lab for future firmware/software updates
* No colour screen, only monochrome with no touchscreen capabilities
* Poor quality & low FPS camera
* No local AI capabilities, leading to more potential print failures compared to newer Bambu Lab printers

BambuLab X1C ($1199-$1449)
--------------------------

This printer is for you want a no-compromises 3D printer that can handle pretty much anything you throw at 
it with incredible speed and reliability while using engineering-grade filaments. This printer comes at $1199 
for just the printer and $1449 for the combo that includes BambuLab's multimaterial system which can handle 4 
filament rolls at once.

.. note:: This printer is **expensive** and is targeted towards advanced filaments. The P1P can print basic filaments
          such as PLA/PETG about as fast and well as the BambuLab X1C at half the price. If you have the budget for 
          an X1C, it may be worth considering buying 2 P1Ps instead if you don't need all the bells and whistles the 
          X1C has and plan to only print PLA/PETG.


X1C Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Extremely fast CoreXY motion system
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Full Color Touchscreen
* Removable Beds of All Surfaces
* All-Metal Direct Drive Extruder
* WiFi Printing capabilities and remote print monitoring
* 256mm x 256mm x 256mm Print Volume
* Heated chamber allows for more advanced engineering materials
* LIDAR sensor for flow calibration and first layer quality checking
* Stock hardened hotend capable of most filled and abrasive filaments
* Automatic print failure detection

X1C Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Replacement parts are proprietary from Bambu Lab (albeit well-priced)
* Carbon Fiber rods can wear out over time
* Reliant on Bambu Lab for future firmware/software updates
* This printer doesn't shine if you don't use it for advanced filaments, and may not be worth the cost if you don't plan to

AnkerMake M5 ($699)
-------------------

.. warning:: This printer should be avoided as AnkerMake has pulled out of FDM 3D printing and will no longer produce or sell the M5.
  Reports online show that parts are dwindling in availability, and as they are not common parts, it may be difficult to find third-party replacements.

Anker's new entry into the 3D printer market, the AnkerMake M5, is a very reasonably priced printer for the features it
brings. With print failure detection, speed printing capabilities, and an extremely friendly interface with almost no setup, 
the M5 is a great option.


M5 Features
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Cartesian Motion System optimized for speed
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Bed
* Direct Drive Extruder
* WiFi Printing capabilities and remote print monitoring
* 235mm x 235mm x 250mm Print Volume

AnkerMake M5C ($399)
--------------------
.. warning:: This printer should be avoided as AnkerMake has exited the FDM 3D printing market and will no longer produce or sell the M5C.
  Replacement parts are becoming increasingly scarce, and since they use proprietary components, third-party alternatives may be difficult to source.
  Additionally, the M5C lacks a built-in screen and relies entirely on the companion app. If AnkerMake discontinues app support, the printer will become unusable.

Anker's budget 3D printing machine, the AnkerMake M5C, is an absolute bargain for the features and speed it brings. 
This printer has speed printing capabilities and an extremely friendly interface with almost no setup. This is one of
the cheapest printers that can reach 0.5m/s speeds while printing, which alone makes it stand out.

M5C Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Cartesian Motion System optimized for speed
* Auto Bed Leveling
* Removable Bed
* All-Metal Direct Drive Extruder
* WiFi Printing capabilities
* 220mm x 220mm x 250mm Print Volume
* Extremely friendly software and setup for new users

M5C Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Replacement parts are proprietary from AnkerMake, and parts are no longer available
* Reliant on Anker for future firmware/software updates
* Limited on speed compared to CoreXY, but still has unrivaled speed at this price and availability
* No screen on the printer, all monitoring must be done digitally
