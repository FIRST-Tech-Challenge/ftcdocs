*Gracious Professionalism®*
===========================

*Gracious Professionalism®* is part of the ethos of *FIRST*. It’s a way of doing
things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and
respects individuals and the community.  *Gracious Professionalism* is not
clearly defined for a reason. It can and should mean different things to
everyone.

Some possible meanings of *Gracious Professionalism* include:

*  gracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win,
*  gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their actions,
*  professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to use that knowledge responsibly, and
*  gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing to others and to themselves.

In the context of *FIRST*, this means that all teams and participants should:

*  learn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with respect and kindness in the process, and 
*  avoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or unappreciated.

Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and genuinely blended.  In
the end, *Gracious Professionalism* is part of pursuing a meaningful life. When
professionals use knowledge in a gracious manner and individuals act with
integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and society benefits.

   *The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality, well-informed work in a
   manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious Professionalism seems
   to be a good descriptor for part of the ethos of FIRST. It is part of what
   makes FIRST different and wonderful.*

   - Dr. Woodie Flowers, (1943 – 2019), Distinguished Advisor to *FIRST*

It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with your team and
reinforcing it regularly. We recommend providing your team with real-life
examples of *Gracious Professionalism* in practice, such as when a team loans
valuable materials or expertise to another team that they will later face as an
opponent in competition. Routinely highlight opportunities to display *Gracious
Professionalism* at events and encourage team members to suggest ways in which
they can demonstrate this quality themselves and through outreach activities.
