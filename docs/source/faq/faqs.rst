-------------

    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: What do I need to bring to my Structured Judging Appointment?

        Teams should bring their robot, Portfolio and as many members of the team who want to participate in the presentation. Please note that at some events, 
        the Portfolio is collected when the team checks in for the event.

    .. grid-item-card:: What feedback will we receive from the judges?

        Judges complete the feedback form immediately after the team has completed their Structured interview. Feedback is limited to the initial Structured interview and does 
        not include the team's performance in follow-up Pit interviews or their Portfolio.

    .. grid-item-card:: Is my team required to prepare a 5 minute presentation?

        Teams are not required to prepare a 5 minute presentation, but teams should let the judges know they do 
        not have a presentation when they enter the room. The judges will begin to ask the team questions at the beginning of 
        the interview. 


Competition FAQs
--------------------

.. grid:: 1
    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: Who on my team needs to be with the robot for inspection?

        At least one student must be present during inspection per the Competition Manual.
        However, inspectors will ask questions about the mechanical and electrical components of your robot.
        Ideally, you have one or more team members who can answer such questions.
        In addition, you may need to turn your robot and driver station on and demonstrate your robot complies with a particular rule like sizing.
        That may involve someone from the drive team if you need to use a gamepad to operate a mechanism or place the robot in its starting configuration.
        Look at the self inspection checklist, you can generally determine what you're doing based on the checklist.
        
    .. grid-item-card:: Why aren’t you going to replay that match?

        There are only certain situations that warrant replaying a match. Consult the Competition Manual to understand what conditions and processes can result in a replay. 
        Typically unless something went wrong with the field or field staff there will not be grounds for a replay. A malfunctioning robot typically does not provide grounds
        for a replay. 

    .. grid-item-card:: Why did you replay a match for someone else, but not us?

        The situation was different. If necessary, teams can talk with the head referee in the competition area Question Box.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why won’t you fix that score? We have video (or photographs) to prove the score is wrong!

        Teams can go the Question Box so they can discuss this issue with the head referee. No photographs or videos will be reviewed.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why don’t you fix/cleanup the wireless environment? It’s obvious the wireless environment is disruptive and causing disconnects.

        Teams can work with the event FTA or Event Director if they have questions about the WiFi environment. 

    .. grid-item-card:: What do we do if we think the scoring referees scored our match wrong or the scorekeeper put the wrong score into the computer.

        If a team has questions about a match outcome, they should send one student representative to the Question Box to talk to the Head Referee (do not interrupt matches for 
        this conversation). If the referees agree that they made a mistake, they can correct it. If the referees are confident in their score, the team should accept that 
        decision. Check the Competition Manual for more information about key volunteer roles, tournament operations, and how to use the Question Box.
