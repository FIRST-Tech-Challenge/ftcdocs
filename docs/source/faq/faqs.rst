Judging FAQs
-------------

.. grid:: 1
    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: What do I need to bring to my Judging Appointment?

        Teams should bring their robot, their engineering portfolio, their control award 
        submission, and their request for feedback form. Please note that at some events, 
        the engineering portfolio, control award submission and feedback request form are 
        collected when the team checks in for the event.

    .. grid-item-card:: What feedback will we receive from the judges?

        Judges complete the feedback form after the team has completed their formal interview, and after the 
        Judges have reviewed the Engineering Portfolio. Feedback is limited to the initial interview and 
        Engineering Portfolio only.

    .. grid-item-card:: Is my team required to prepare a 5 minute presentation?

        Teams are not required to prepare a 5 minute presentation. Teams should let the judges know they do 
        not have a formal presentation. The judges will begin to ask the team questions at the beginning of 
        the interview. Teams are not penalized in any way if they do not have a prepared presentation.


Competition FAQs
--------------------

.. grid:: 1
    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: Who on my team needs to be with the robot for inspection?

        It depends on which inspection station you're visiting and how your event is configured. 
        The inspectors at Field Inspection like to see the Drive Team, Human Player (if there is 
        one), and Drive Coach. The inspectors at Robot Inspection really just want to see team 
        members who have the best idea of what's going on with the robot (mechanically and 
        electrically). Look at your inspection sheets, you can generally determine what you're 
        doing based on the checklist.
        
    .. grid-item-card:: Why aren’t you going to replay that match?

        There are only certain situations that warrant replaying a match. Unless we can prove that it was a 
        field fault or Wi-Fi interference, we cannot replay a match.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why did you replay a match for someone else, but not us?

        The situation was different. If necessary, teams can talk with the head referee in the competition area Question Box.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why won’t you fix that score? We have video (or photographs) to prove the score is wrong!

        Teams can go the question box so they can discuss this issue with the head referee. No photographs or videos wil be reviewed per GM1 <C02>.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why don’t you fix/cleanup the wireless environment? It’s obvious the wireless environment is disruptive and causing disconnects.

        WiFi is observed throughout the event.

    .. grid-item-card:: What do we do if we think the scoring referees scored our match wrong or the scorekeeper put the wrong score into the computer.

        Teams may formally protest a match for a period of time not to exceed three matches following the match in question. If a team wants to dispute a score, 
        one student representative should wait patiently in the designated Question Box area for the head referee (do not interrupt matches for this conversation). 
        If the referees agree that they made a mistake, they can correct it. If the referees are confident in their score, the team should accept that decision. 
        Refer to  GM1 <C02>.
