    OpMode
        An Operational Mode (OpMode) is the heart of any *FIRST* Tech Challenge routine. This refers to a User Defined Class that outlines the behavior of the robot during a certain period of the game. 
        Users are able to utilize all manners of functionality from sensors to motors and servors to dictate the behavior of the robot.
        For example, there might be an OpMode that causes the robot to drive forward for 5 seconds and then stop.
    
    Class
        A Class is a blueprint for an object. It tells the program what variables and functions an object will have. 
        For example, a class might be called "Robot" and have variables such as "motorLeft" and "motorRight" and functions such as "driveForward" and "driveBackward".

    Object
        An Object is an instance of a class. It is a variable that is defined by a class. 
        For example, an object might be called "robot" and be defined by the class "Robot". 
        This object would have variables such as "motorLeft" and "motorRight" and functions such as "driveForward" and "driveBackward".
    
    Variable
        A Variable is a value that is held in memory by the robot. It has a type, value, and name. 
        The type refers to what kind of value the variable holds (integer, string, etc.). 
        The value is the actual value of the variable (1, "Hello World", etc.).
        The name is what the variable is called in the program (motorLeft, motorRight, etc.).

    Integer
        An Integer is a type of variable that holds a number with no decimal places. (Eg. -3, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
    
    String
        A string is a type of variable that holds a sequence of characters. (Eg. "Hello World!", "Robot", "2023", etc.)

    CAD
        CAD stands for Computer Aided Design. It is a type of software that allows users to create 3D models of objects. 
        In the context of robotics, CAD is ofteb used to create 3D models of robots and robot parts. 
        This allows users to visualize their robot before they build it while making sure that everything fits together.
