Robot Annual Maintenance
========================

Started in the 2023-2024 season, Tech Tips are segments released in the
*FIRST* Tech Challenge `Team E-mail Blast
<https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/team-blast-archive>`__.
Sometimes the Tech Tips are included in whole in the email blast, but sometimes
there is more content than is reasonable in the email blast so partial content
is included in the blast with the rest of the content here.

**Robot Annual Maintenance Tips**

Just like "spring cleaning," an annual check-up for your robot's electronics
and software is essential to prevent common issues caused by aging components.

* Secure XT30 Connections: If your power cables feel loose in the REV Control
  Hub or Expansion Hub's XT30 connectors, avoid using glues like hot glue.
  These only hide an unstable connection between the metal contacts, which can
  lead to intermittent power loss under shock. Instead, the metal pins on the
  device's XT30 connectors likely need to be uncompressed. Refer to REV
  Robotics tutorials for proper maintenance of these pins.

* Battery Rejuvenation (Charge Cycling): Older NiMH batteries can develop
  crystalline structures, increasing internal resistance and reducing power
  output. Charge cycling—discharging slowly to 10V (500-600mA) then
  recharging—can break down these crystals. This should only be done with
  advanced chargers (e.g., Toolkit Q4AC, Hitec RDX2) for batteries older than
  one season or those with an internal resistance exceeding 150% of their new
  value.

* Continuous Wiring Inspection: Make wiring inspection an ongoing task, not
  just an annual one. Regularly check for frayed insulation, loose connections,
  or bent pins. Specifically, ensure no exposed wire is visible where it meets
  XT30 connector housings to prevent potential shorts.

* Software Updates Are Key: Always update your Control Hub OS to the latest
  version (e.g., 1.1.6 for Wi-Fi driver security) and your FIRST Tech Challenge
  SDK (e.g., SDK 11.0) for improved performance and better support from
  tournament staff.

Following these tips will help ensure your robot's electronics and software are
reliable and competition-ready.
