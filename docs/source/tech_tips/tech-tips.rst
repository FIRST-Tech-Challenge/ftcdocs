.. dropdown:: Week of 09/04/2023 "Battery Charging"

   The *FIRST* Tech Challenge Tech Tip of the week this week is all about Battery
   Charging. There are :ref:`three robot main batteries
   <control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr:robot main battery>` 
   that are legal to use in FIRST Tech Challenge, and they are all
   3000mAh NiMH batteries with an attached 20A fuse. However, the manufacturers
   of the batteries have different battery chargers and different recommended
   charging settings for the batteries. When charging the `TETRIX MAX 12-Volt
   battery
   <https://www.pitsco.com/TETRIX-12-Volt-Rechargeable-NiMH-Battery-Pack>`__,
   on the battery the manufacturer recommends charging at the 0.9A charge rate
   (the lowest setting on most selectable battery chargers) using the `Global
   NiMH battery pack charger
   <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__.  The `Matrix
   12-Volt battery
   <https://www.gobilda.com/matrix-12v-3000mah-nimh-battery/>`__ with the same
   form factor is recommended to be charged with the `goBILDA 12V battery
   charger <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__, which
   does not have a user-selectable charge rate switch but has a max charge rate
   of 1.0A.  However, the `REV 12-Volt Slim Battery
   <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1302/>`__ is recommended to be charged
   with the `REV Battery Charger <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1299/>`__
   using the 1.8A charge rate setting. To ensure safety, proper charging, and a
   long battery life, make sure you’re charging your batteries at the
   manufacturer’s recommended charge rates!

.. dropdown:: Week of 09/11/2023 "Updating the Robot Controller App"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the week is all about updating software on your
   Control Hub. If you use :ref:`Android Studio
   <programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial:android studio programming tutorial>`, 
   did you know that you’re not supposed to use the `REV Hardware Client
   <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__ to update the Robot
   Controller (RC) App? Blocks and OnBot Java programs are stored on the Robot
   Controller (SmartPhone or Control Hub) differently than Android Studio
   programs, and this has a major effect on how updates can be managed on the
   device. Read more about this at :ref:`Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App
   <ftc_sdk/updating/rc_app/Updating-the-RC-App:Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App>`.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/16/2023 "Battery Maintenance Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is an extension to our first-ever Tech Tip
   of the Week regarding battery maintenance. Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH or
   Ni-MH) batteries, like those used in FIRST Tech Challenge, do require
   periodic maintenance to keep them healthy! Every day, NiMH batteries lose on
   average 1% of their charge capacity at normal room temperature - at colder
   temperatures this decline slows a bit but does not stop it. This means that
   every 2-3 months it’s important to recharge your batteries to keep them
   healthy - there is no off-season for batteries! It’s also recommended to
   mark your batteries with tape and a sharpie to mark (1) Your team number
   (never lose a battery at a competition!), (2) What year the battery was
   purchased, (3) Give your batteries names so you can differentiate batteries
   easily, and (4) optionally provide a tick mark each time the battery is
   recharged. NiMH batteries can generally last 200-300 recharge cycles before
   their internal resistance declines to the point where it’s time to replace
   them, and keeping track of charge cycles is an easy way to track how “used”
   the battery is before needing to have its internal resistance checked.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/23/2023 "Control and Expansion Hub Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week provides useful tips when using Control and
   Expansion Hubs.  

   - The RS485 data cable ports that provide data between Control and Expansion
     Hubs are redundant - you can use two data cables utilizing both ports to
     ensure that if one cable fails communications aren’t lost.  

   - Encoder ports 0 and 3 are hardware-counted, but ports 1 and 2 are
     software-counted. This means higher counts-per-revolution encoders (like
     the REV Through-Bore Encoder) should be placed on Ports 0 or 3 to ensure
     counts aren’t missed, and lower counts-per-revolution encoders (like the
     goBILDA Odometry Pods or most motors) can be connected to any port.  
   
   - Servo port pairs (0,1), (2, 3), and (4,5) each share a common power
     supply, so if you’re using higher-current servos (like a goBILDA torque
     servo) directly on the Control or Expansion Hub you should only use ports
     (0, 2, 4) or (1, 3, 5) in order to maximize the power available to each
     servo. If you need to use more than 3 high-current servos per hub,
     consider using a `REV Servo Power Module
     <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1144/>`__.  

   - Each Digital and Analog sensor connector on the Control and Expansion Hub
     each have 2 signal channels. Some REV sensors are only designed to be
     configured and used on the N or N+1 channels. Read the documentation for
     each sensor carefully!  

   - The USB 2.0 port shares the same USB bus as the internal Control Hub
     radio. ESD or other electrical interference that affects devices (like
     webcams) plugged into that port may cause a loss of communications. When
     using a USB webcam, use the USB 3.0 port first.  

   - USB C-to-C cables do not work properly with the Control Hub, only USB
     A-to-C cables do.  

   - If you’re utilizing the onboard IMU, Do not plug I2C devices into Port 0
     unless absolutely necessary. Port 0 shares an I2C bus with the IMU, and
     misbehaving devices (or devices that don’t “play well with others”)
     plugged into Port 0 can cause the IMU to stop communicating.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/30/2023 "Computer Requirements"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week focuses on required computer hardware for
   *FIRST* programs. If you’re looking to buy a laptop and want to make sure you
   meet the minimum requirements for the program you’re participating in, like
   *FIRST* Tech Challenge, this tech tip is for you! There is a new 
   :ref:`Computer Requirements <programming_resources/laptops/laptops:Computer Requirements for *FIRST* Programs>`
   document on ftc-docs that provides a cross-program view of the laptop
   requirements for all *FIRST* programs. It also has examples of the different
   laptops and a list of the required features needed for each program. Check
   it out!

.. dropdown:: Week of 11/06/2023 "Driver Hub or Smartphone?"

   This week's Tech Tip of the Week briefly discusses the pros and cons of 
   Smartphones versus the Driver Hub. Which one should you use? Are there 
   hidden benefits or perils for using one over the other?

   The REV Driver Hub is the standard *FIRST* Tech Challenge Driver Station
   hardware device. It boasts three USB-A ports for plugging in gamepads,
   a USB-C port used for communication and charging, a large touch screen,
   and an unused Ethernet port (for future-proofing). This device runs the
   Android operating system, maintained by REV Robotics, and uses Wi-Fi
   to communicate with the REV Control Hub. 

      **Driver Hub Pros**

      - Driver Hub and Control Hub combo use 802.11w for communications. No
        approved Smartphone supports 802.11w communications.

        - 802.11w offers encryption of control packets, which prevents many
          Wi-Fi attacks by remote routers/devices.

      - Driver Hub is a "standard" *FIRST* Tech Challenge Driver Station device, 
        which provides long-term support for *FIRST* Tech Challenge. The average
        SmartPhone is deprecated within 2 years after being released, but the
        Driver Hub is supported as long as it's legal to use in *FIRST* Tech
        Challenge.

      - Driver Hub has a USB-C port, which allows for charging while it's being
        used.

        - USB-C port allows use of external battery packs, which are necessary
          for sustained use of PS4 and PS5 gamepads which leech power from the
          Driver Station to charge their own internal batteries.

        - A single 10,000mAh External battery pack allows Control Hub to be
          used non-stop over the course of an entire day.

      - Driver Hub has 3 USB-A ports, so no external USB hubs and additional
        cables are required for using multiple USB gamepads. This makes the
        Driver Hub very compact and easy to manage.

      **Driver Hub Cons**

      - Driver Hub still has Power Management issues

        - Driver Hub needs battery compartment tweak to ensure internal battery
          makes good connection. Foam insert in battery compartment helps, but
          doesn't always perfectly fix the problem.

        - Driver Hub cannot boot if the internal battery is too low, even if 
          plugged into external battery. If battery dies, troubleshooting
          requires removal of battery to power device.

        - Power Management bugs can drain battery while charging.

      - Driver Hub USB ports are fragile

        - Teams carrying their Driver Hubs around without a Driver Station tray
          (NOT RECOMMENDED) have dropped their Driver Hubs with gamepads plugged
          in, and impact can damage USB-A ports.

      - Display screen ribbon cable comes loose

        - If the screen stops working, opening the back of the device and 
          re-seating the screen ribbon cable can sometimes fix screen issues.

      - Turning off the display unloads gamepad drivers, but turning the display
        back on does not reload them. USB devices must be re-plugged in order to
        trigger USB driver loading.

      - USB-C to USB-C cables do not work with Driver Hub. USB-A to USB-C cables 
        are required in order to use the USB-C port.

   On the other hand, several off-the-shelf SmartPhones are supported, including
   the Motorola Moto E4 and Moto E5 phones. These devices, like the REV Driver
   Hub, run the Android mobile operating system and use Wi-Fi to talk to the 
   REV Control Hub (therefore no SIM card or cell plan is required). SmartPhones
   use USB-OTG to interface with gamepads and external USB hubs necessary for 
   operating multiple gamepads.
   
      **SmartPhone Pros**

      - SmartPhones are typically cheaper than Driver Hubs, and generally survive
        being dropped better.

      - SmartPhones don't have the same power management issues that Driver Hubs
        are known to have.

      - Some teams report having better Wi-Fi consistency with SmartPhones than 
        Driver Hubs, though that has not been verified or debunked in any way.

      **SmartPhone Cons**

      - There are only a small number of approved Android Smartphones, none of
        which are still supported by the manufacturers of the phones.

        - SmartPhones are deprecated typically within 2 years after being 
          released. Security updates and OS updates are not guaranteed.

        - The number of approved SmartPhones are dwindling, and SmartPhones
          are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. New SmartPhones are
          not being approved to replace older ones.

      - Android is not a consistent platform in the Mobile Phone industry. Each
        manufacturer, and sometimes even within product families, will produce
        their own "flavor" of Android which has different software requirements
        and behaviors. Supporting the different manufacturers in the changing
        Android landscape is near impossible.

        - There is very little consistency between smartphones of the same
          model sold in different countries - each will have their own
          firmware with their own quirks, often impossible to debug or avoid.

        - *FIRST* Tech Challenge is not enough of a volume consumer to be able to
          set requirements or have partnerships with SmartPhone manufacturers.

      - SmartPhones cannot use 802.11w for encryption of Wi-Fi control packets,
        which makes the connection between devices vulnerable. Rogue Access Point
        Detection and Quarantine features within venue network security systems
        (like within schools and other venues) can interrupt these communications
        seemingly randomly, making connections difficult to maintain.

      - SmartPhones cannot be used at the same time they're being charged, so 
        teams frequently run down the internal batteries on the phones during the
        course of an event. Careful battery management is required.

        - PS4 and PS5 gamepads with internal batteries will further drain the
          SmartPhone batteries, as they leech power from the Driver Station in
          order to maintain a full charge level for their own batteries. 

      - SmartPhones require USB-OTG cables and external USB Hubs are also
        required in order to use multiple gamepads, and each cable/connection
        and device is a potential source of failure. Extreme care must be taken
        to ensure the connections remain solid.
