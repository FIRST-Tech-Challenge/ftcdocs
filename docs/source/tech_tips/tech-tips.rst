.. dropdown:: Week of 09/04/2023 "Battery Charging"

   The *FIRST* Tech Challenge Tech Tip of the week this week is all about Battery
   Charging. There are :ref:`three robot main batteries
   <control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr:robot main battery>` 
   that are legal to use in FIRST Tech Challenge, and they are all
   3000mAh NiMH batteries with an attached 20A fuse. However, the manufacturers
   of the batteries have different battery chargers and different recommended
   charging settings for the batteries. When charging the `TETRIX MAX 12-Volt
   battery
   <https://www.pitsco.com/TETRIX-12-Volt-Rechargeable-NiMH-Battery-Pack>`__,
   on the battery the manufacturer recommends charging at the 0.9A charge rate
   (the lowest setting on most selectable battery chargers) using the `Global
   NiMH battery pack charger
   <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__.  The `Matrix
   12-Volt battery
   <https://www.gobilda.com/matrix-12v-3000mah-nimh-battery/>`__ with the same
   form factor is recommended to be charged with the `goBILDA 12V battery
   charger <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__, which
   does not have a user-selectable charge rate switch but has a max charge rate
   of 1.0A.  However, the `REV 12-Volt Slim Battery
   <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1302/>`__ is recommended to be charged
   with the `REV Battery Charger <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1299/>`__
   using the 1.8A charge rate setting. To ensure safety, proper charging, and a
   long battery life, make sure you’re charging your batteries at the
   manufacturer’s recommended charge rates!

.. dropdown:: Week of 09/11/2023 "Updating the Robot Controller App"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the week is all about updating software on your
   Control Hub. If you use :ref:`Android Studio
   <programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial:android studio programming tutorial>`, 
   did you know that you’re not supposed to use the `REV Hardware Client
   <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__ to update the Robot
   Controller (RC) App? Blocks and OnBot Java programs are stored on the Robot
   Controller (SmartPhone or Control Hub) differently than Android Studio
   programs, and this has a major effect on how updates can be managed on the
   device. Read more about this at :ref:`Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App
   <ftc_sdk/updating/rc_app/Updating-the-RC-App:Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App>`.

   information you otherwise can’t find in one place - check them out! 

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/16/2023 "Battery Maintenance Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is an extension to our first-ever Tech Tip
   of the Week regarding battery maintenance. Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH or
   Ni-MH) batteries, like those used in FIRST Tech Challenge, do require
   periodic maintenance to keep them healthy! Every day, NiMH batteries lose on
   average 1% of their charge capacity at normal room temperature - at colder
   temperatures this decline slows a bit but does not stop it. This means that
   every 2-3 months it’s important to recharge your batteries to keep them
   healthy - there is no off-season for batteries! It’s also recommended to
   mark your batteries with tape and a sharpie to mark (1) Your team number
   (never lose a battery at a competition!), (2) What year the battery was
   purchased, (3) Give your batteries names so you can differentiate batteries
   easily, and (4) optionally provide a tick mark each time the battery is
   recharged. NiMH batteries can generally last 200-300 recharge cycles before
   their internal resistance declines to the point where it’s time to replace
   them, and keeping track of charge cycles is an easy way to track how “used”
   the battery is before needing to have its internal resistance checked.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/23/2023 "Control and Expansion Hub Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week provides useful tips when using Control and
   Expansion Hubs.  

   - The RS485 data cable ports that provide data between Control and Expansion
     Hubs are redundant - you can use two data cables utilizing both ports to
     ensure that if one cable fails communications aren’t lost.  

   - Encoder ports 0 and 3 are hardware-counted, but ports 1 and 2 are
     software-counted. This means higher counts-per-revolution encoders (like
     the REV Through-Bore Encoder) should be placed on Ports 0 or 3 to ensure
     counts aren’t missed, and lower counts-per-revolution encoders (like the
     goBILDA Odometry Pods or most motors) can be connected to any port.  
   
   - Servo port pairs (0,1), (2, 3), and (4,5) each share a common power
     supply, so if you’re using higher-current servos (like a goBILDA torque
     servo) directly on the Control or Expansion Hub you should only use ports
     (0, 2, 4) or (1, 3, 5) in order to maximize the power available to each
     servo. If you need to use more than 3 high-current servos per hub,
     consider using a `REV Servo Power Module
     <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1144/>`__.  

   - Each Digital and Analog sensor connector on the Control and Expansion Hub
     each have 2 signal channels. Some REV sensors are only designed to be
     configured and used on the N or N+1 channels. Read the documentation for
     each sensor carefully!  

   - The USB 2.0 port shares the same USB bus as the internal Control Hub
     radio. ESD or other electrical interference that affects devices (like
     webcams) plugged into that port may cause a loss of communications. When
     using a USB webcam, use the USB 3.0 port first.  

   - USB C-to-C cables do not work properly with the Control Hub, only USB
     A-to-C cables do.  

   - If you’re utilizing the onboard IMU, Do not plug I2C devices into Port 0
     unless absolutely necessary. Port 0 shares an I2C bus with the IMU, and
     misbehaving devices (or devices that don’t “play well with others”)
     plugged into Port 0 can cause the IMU to stop communicating.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/30/2023 "Computer Requirements"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week focuses on required computer hardware for
   *FIRST* programs. If you’re looking to buy a laptop and want to make sure you
   meet the minimum requirements for the program you’re participating in, like
   *FIRST* Tech Challenge, this tech tip is for you! There is a new 
   :ref:`Computer Requirements <programming_resources/laptops/laptops:Computer Requirements for *FIRST* Programs>`
   document on ftc-docs that provides a cross-program view of the laptop
   requirements for all *FIRST* programs. It also has examples of the different
   laptops and a list of the required features needed for each program. Check
   it out!

.. dropdown:: Week of 11/06/2023 "Driver Hub or Smartphone?"

   This week's Tech Tip of the Week briefly discusses the pros and cons of 
   Smartphones versus the Driver Hub. Which one should you use? Are there 
   hidden benefits or perils for using one over the other?

   The REV Driver Hub is the standard *FIRST* Tech Challenge Driver Station
   hardware device. It boasts three USB-A ports for plugging in gamepads,
   a USB-C port used for communication and charging, a large touch screen,
   and an unused Ethernet port (for future-proofing). This device runs the
   Android operating system, maintained by REV Robotics, and uses Wi-Fi
   to communicate with the REV Control Hub. 

      **Driver Hub Pros**

      - Driver Hub and Control Hub combo use 802.11w for communications. No
        approved Smartphone supports 802.11w communications.

        - 802.11w offers encryption of control packets, which prevents many
          Wi-Fi attacks by remote routers/devices.

      - Driver Hub is a "standard" *FIRST* Tech Challenge Driver Station device, 
        which provides long-term support for *FIRST* Tech Challenge. The average
        SmartPhone is deprecated within 2 years after being released, but the
        Driver Hub is supported as long as it's legal to use in *FIRST* Tech
        Challenge.

      - Driver Hub has a USB-C port, which allows for charging while it's being
        used.

        - USB-C port allows use of external battery packs, which are necessary
          for sustained use of PS4 and PS5 gamepads which leech power from the
          Driver Station to charge their own internal batteries.

        - A single 10,000mAh External battery pack allows Control Hub to be
          used non-stop over the course of an entire day.

      - Driver Hub has 3 USB-A ports, so no external USB hubs and additional
        cables are required for using multiple USB gamepads. This makes the
        Driver Hub very compact and easy to manage.

      **Driver Hub Cons**

      - Driver Hub still has Power Management issues

        - Driver Hub needs battery compartment tweak to ensure internal battery
          makes good connection. Foam insert in battery compartment helps, but
          doesn't always perfectly fix the problem.

        - Driver Hub cannot boot if the internal battery is too low, even if 
          plugged into external battery. If battery dies, troubleshooting
          requires removal of battery to power device.

        - Power Management bugs can drain battery while charging.

      - Driver Hub USB ports are fragile

        - Teams carrying their Driver Hubs around without a Driver Station tray
          (NOT RECOMMENDED) have dropped their Driver Hubs with gamepads plugged
          in, and impact can damage USB-A ports.

      - Display screen ribbon cable comes loose

        - If the screen stops working, opening the back of the device and 
          re-seating the screen ribbon cable can sometimes fix screen issues.

      - Turning off the display unloads gamepad drivers, but turning the display
        back on does not reload them. USB devices must be re-plugged in order to
        trigger USB driver loading.

      - USB-C to USB-C cables do not work with Driver Hub. USB-A to USB-C cables 
        are required in order to use the USB-C port.

   On the other hand, several off-the-shelf SmartPhones are supported, including
   the Motorola Moto E4 and Moto E5 phones. These devices, like the REV Driver
   Hub, run the Android mobile operating system and use Wi-Fi to talk to the 
   REV Control Hub (therefore no SIM card or cell plan is required). SmartPhones
   use USB-OTG to interface with gamepads and external USB hubs necessary for 
   operating multiple gamepads.
   
      **SmartPhone Pros**

      - SmartPhones are typically cheaper than Driver Hubs, and generally survive
        being dropped better.

      - SmartPhones don't have the same power management issues that Driver Hubs
        are known to have.

      - Some teams report having better Wi-Fi consistency with SmartPhones than 
        Driver Hubs, though that has not been verified or debunked in any way.

      **SmartPhone Cons**

      - There are only a small number of approved Android Smartphones, none of
        which are still supported by the manufacturers of the phones.

        - SmartPhones are deprecated typically within 2 years after being 
          released. Security updates and OS updates are not guaranteed.

        - The number of approved SmartPhones are dwindling, and SmartPhones
          are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. New SmartPhones are
          not being approved to replace older ones.

      - Android is not a consistent platform in the Mobile Phone industry. Each
        manufacturer, and sometimes even within product families, will produce
        their own "flavor" of Android which has different software requirements
        and behaviors. Supporting the different manufacturers in the changing
        Android landscape is near impossible.

        - There is very little consistency between smartphones of the same
          model sold in different countries - each will have their own
          firmware with their own quirks, often impossible to debug or avoid.

        - *FIRST* Tech Challenge is not enough of a volume consumer to be able to
          set requirements or have partnerships with SmartPhone manufacturers.

      - SmartPhones cannot use 802.11w for encryption of Wi-Fi control packets,
        which makes the connection between devices vulnerable. Rogue Access Point
        Detection and Quarantine features within venue network security systems
        (like within schools and other venues) can interrupt these communications
        seemingly randomly, making connections difficult to maintain.

      - SmartPhones cannot be used at the same time they're being charged, so 
        teams frequently run down the internal batteries on the phones during the
        course of an event. Careful battery management is required.

        - PS4 and PS5 gamepads with internal batteries will further drain the
          SmartPhone batteries, as they leech power from the Driver Station in
          order to maintain a full charge level for their own batteries. 

      - SmartPhones require USB-OTG cables and external USB Hubs are also
        required in order to use multiple gamepads, and each cable/connection
        and device is a potential source of failure. Extreme care must be taken
        to ensure the connections remain solid.

.. dropdown:: Week of 11/13/2023 "Robot and Driver Station Self-Inspect"

   This Week’s Tech Tip of the Week is here to help teams prepare for
   inspection at their events. Aside from making sure that your robot is within
   the Maximum Starting Size, ensuring that your robot code can correctly pass
   Field Inspection, and other tasks in the `Robot Inspection Checklist
   <https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-inspection-checklist.pdf>`__,
   teams need to make sure their robot software and hardware apps are updated
   to the latest and greatest versions and that their hardware is configured
   correctly. There is a tool within the Driver Station App 3-dot menu called
   the “Self-Inspect” feature that can help teams perform a quick check to
   ensure their hardware and software is configured correctly. Depending on
   your hardware configuration the Self-Inspect screens may be formatted
   differently or have different options listed, so :ref:`there is a handy
   reference on ftc-docs
   <hardware_and_software_configuration/self_inspect/self-inspect:*FIRST* Tech Challenge Self-Inspect>`
   that can help you understand the Self-Inspect tool. Make sure you’re ready
   for inspection!

.. dropdown:: Week of 11/27/2023 "HuskyLens Intro"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week comes to us from Chris Johannesen, 2023
   *FIRST* Tech Challenge Volunteer of the Year and author of many ftc-docs
   tutorials. Have you heard of the HuskyLens and want to learn how to properly
   connect one to a Control Hub, learn how to use it to detect Team Props, and
   use the HuskyLens samples included with SDK 9.0.0 and newer? Chris has this
   and more in his :ref:`HuskyLens Tutorial
   <devices/huskylens/huskylens:HuskyLens Intro for *FIRST* Tech Challenge>` on
   ftc-docs, check it out! 

.. dropdown:: Week of 12/04/2023 "Using Encoders"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week highlights proper encoder use within the
   FIRST Tech Challenge SDK. Encoders are the devices that track how much a
   motor shaft has rotated, which the vast majority of motors used in FIRST
   Tech Challenge have built-in. The encoders on the motors can help track a
   motor, but they can also be used to help synchronize and control motors via
   “Motor Modes” built into the Control and Expansion Hub firmware. Did you
   know that most programmers use these motor modes incorrectly? More on these
   “Motor Modes” and the correct way to use them can be found on the `REV
   Robotics Encoder documentation
   <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/programming/using-encoder-feedback>`__.

.. dropdown:: Week of 12/11/2023 "Using Servos with the Control/Expansion Hubs"

   In case you missed it (ICYMI) there was a fantastic `question on the FTC-QA
   <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/qa/229>`__ that prompted an in-depth
   discussion about servos in FIRST Tech Challenge - the question was in regard
   to servo compatibility and operation/performance on a REV Control Hub, REV
   Expansion Hub, and REV Servo Power Module. While the full explanation was
   too much for a Q&A answer, the complete answer was provided on the
   `FTC-Community forums
   <https://ftc-community.firstinspires.org/t/rev-control-hub-servo-port-compatibility/858>`__.
   If you are using servos (or want to use servos) on your robot, the full
   answer contains an explanation of how servos are managed on a Control and
   Expansion Hub that you cannot get anywhere else! 

.. dropdown:: Week of 12/18/2023 "Automatic Auto to Driver Control Program Switching"

   Did you know that it’s possible for the Driver Station to 
   :ref:`automatically load your Driver Controlled OpMode
   <programming_resources/shared/auto_load_opmode/auto-load-opmode:Automatically
   Loading a Driver Controlled Op Mode>` as soon as your Autonomous OpMode has
   completed? Lots of teams go into panic mode immediately after Autonomous has
   completed - they’re trying to navigate and select the proper Driver
   Controlled OpMode, Initialize, and Run the OpMode while also picking up
   their gamepads and preparing to drive. Skip all that panic and confusion and
   let the Driver Station queue up your Driver Controlled OpMode for you! This
   week’s Tech Tip of the Week focuses on how to :ref:`designate a Driver-Controlled
   OpMode <programming_resources/shared/auto_load_opmode/auto-load-opmode:Automatically
   Loading a Driver Controlled Op Mode>` that is to be loaded once an Autonomous OpMode has completed. You
   still have to initialize and run the OpMode at the proper time, but at least
   the Driver Station can do the heavy lifting of swapping and loading the
   OpMode for you!

.. dropdown:: Week of 12/25/2023 "Protect your Robot with a Password"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is a gentle reminder that strong passwords
   and regular backups make for good competition. Even when competing at a
   Scrimmage before your competition season starts, be sure to change your
   Wi-Fi password on your Control Hub from the default password of “password”
   to something only your team knows. Anyone who knows your password can easily
   gain access to your robot and change or delete your programs, change
   important settings, or even force your controller to revert to factory
   settings! And with that said, it’s ALWAYS a good idea to keep backups of
   your programs - it’s especially important to regularly 
   :ref:`download all Blocks
   <programming_resources/tutorial_specific/blocks/managing_opmodes/managing-opmodes:downloading an opmode>`
   and OnBot Java programs that are normally only stored on the robot in case
   anything happens!

.. dropdown:: Week of 01/08/2024 "OnBot Java Backups"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is for all those who program in OnBot Java.
   Have you ever been worried that your OnBot Java programs could suddenly
   magically vanish? Has it ever happened to you? One lesser-known feature of
   OnBot Java is automatic backups - each time you “compile all” in OnBot Java
   the system saves a copy of all source code, up to 30 compilations deep. In
   order to find these backups, you must connect to the Control Hub via USB
   from a Windows machine and navigate to the “FIRST” folder on the device’s
   internal storage. In this folder you’ll find a “java” folder, and within
   that is the “srcBackups” folder. Here you’ll find zip files containing each
   backup with a time/date stamp. Happy Programming!

.. dropdown:: Week of 01/22/2024 "REV Grounding Strap"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is dedicated to the `REV Resistive
   Grounding Strap <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/>`__; the REV
   Resistive Grounding Strap (RGS) is the only FTC-legal means of providing a
   grounding option for your robot frame or connected structural elements.
   Static electricity has two basic behaviors depending on whether it’s
   building up on a conductive or non-conductive surface; on non-conductive
   surfaces like polycarbonate or other plastics static electricity builds up
   in “pools”, on conductive surfaces like most metals static electricity
   spreads and distributes across the entire surface of the material. Aluminum
   extrusion used on robots typically has a clear non-conductive anodized layer
   used to prevent corrosion of the aluminum but the aluminum under the layer
   is conductive. When using the RGS, it’s important to connect the RGS to
   surfaces where you want to mitigate static buildup. If mounting the RGS to
   aluminum on your robot, it’s recommended to use a `multimeter
   <https://www.amazon.com/KAIWEETS-Multimeter-Resistance-Capacitance-Temperature/dp/B07SHLS639>`__
   to test the continuity between the ring terminal on the RGS to different
   places on the robot to determine if the static buildup will be mitigated by
   the RGS. If testing for resistivity, remember that the REV Grounding Strap
   has a 470 Ohm resistor (with a ~5% tolerance) in-line in the strap - if not
   using an auto-range multimeter, be sure to select a range above 600 Ohms to
   ensure the resistivity is measured properly. It may be necessary to scrape
   the aluminum to create a conductive path between multiple segments of
   aluminum, just remember that a non-conductive oxide layer will eventually
   form on the exposed aluminum. Remember that if you're probing aluminum
   extrusion to check for continuity or resistivity, those areas need to be
   scraped to expose bare metal in order to ensure electrical connectivity.
   “Jumper wires” screwed to aluminum elements can also be added to ensure
   conductivity between components.

.. dropdown:: Week of 01/29/2024 "REV Driver Hub Tips"

   Welcome to the Tech Tip of the Week! This week is a long one, filled with
   great REV Driver Hub tips. Most everything here can be found in REV’s Driver
   Hub Troubleshooting tips page, we’ve just annotated a few of these for the
   most common scenarios you’ll potentially experience with the REV Driver Hub.
   Understand that this Tip of the Week is not meant to disparage the REV
   Driver Hub in any way - no device is perfect, but the REV Driver Hub can
   provide you trouble-free performance if you can understand its nuances and
   take a few additional steps to keep it running optimally.

   1. Make sure your REV Driver Hub time/date is set correctly! This is the cause
      of a number of inspection nightmares and Robot Controller log file
      confusion, the first step should always be to check to make sure the
      Date/Time on the Driver Hub is set correctly. This is set through the normal
      Android System Settings by pulling down the Android Quick Settings pull-down
      twice, tapping the Gear Icon, selecting System, and then selecting “Date &
      Time”.  

   2. USB wall chargers are all the same, right? Wrong. A/C-to-USB wall
      chargers can range drastically in power (measured in Watts) - the REV
      Driver Hub comes with an A/C-to-USB wall charger, and that is the
      recommended wall charger to use to charge the REV Driver Hub. Can you
      use another device to charge the REV Driver Hub? Maybe, but it’s best
      to stick to either the one that ships with the REV Driver Hub or a
      fully-charged USB Battery Pack like the `Anker 10,000mA Power Bank
      <https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B>`__
      which can keep a Driver Hub fully charged all day without ever needing
      to put the Driver Hub to sleep.  

   3. Rechargeable Lithium batteries don’t necessarily work the same way that
      other batteries work, they all have a slightly different usable
      Voltage range. The REV Driver Hub needs to calibrate to the Voltage
      range of the internal lithium battery plugged into it, and to do that
      there’s a full `calibration process
      <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/driver-hub-troubleshooting/driver-hub-battery-troubleshooting#battery-calibration>`__
      that has to be followed for any new battery, along with a
      `verification step
      <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/driver-hub-troubleshooting/driver-hub-battery-troubleshooting#battery-verification>`__.
      DO NOT simply “replace” a drained battery with a new charged one when
      it gets low, the new battery is NOT guaranteed to have the same
      calibration as the first and it is not guaranteed to perform
      optimally. If you’re having problems keeping the REV Driver Hub
      internal battery charged, consider a USB Battery Pack like the `Anker
      10,000mA Power Bank
      <https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B>`__.  

   4. Battery safety in any Lithium Battery system is paramount, and the REV
      Driver Hub has battery safety features that most teams will likely run
      into at least once. The most commonly experienced safety feature is
      the `Battery Lockout system
      <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/driver-hub-troubleshooting/driver-hub-battery-troubleshooting#battery-lockout-recovery>`__.
      If a REV Battery depletes to a level below its recommended safe level,
      or the battery is overcharged, the REV Driver Hub will enter lockout
      mode to protect the battery. In this mode, the REV Driver Hub will not
      power on when the battery button is held down.  The process for
      recovering from Battery Lockout can take several minutes, but it’s
      better than the alternative. It’s not recommended to leave a REV
      Driver Hub on charge unattended for more than 8-10 hours, and
      definitely NOT for multiple days.  

   5. When a user puts the REV Driver Hub to sleep, or if it goes to sleep on
      its own because the Driver Station App main screen is not actively
      running in the foreground, it goes to sleep pretty easily. However,
      when the REV Driver Hub returns from a sleep state, sometimes the
      Wi-Fi and the gamepads will not reload correctly or automatically;
      this requires you to unplug and replug the gamepads from the REV
      Driver Hub before you can use them again, or perform a hard reboot in
      order to bring Wi-Fi connectivity back. Many veteran teams use a
      fully-charged USB Battery Pack, like the `Anker 10,000mA Power Bank
      <https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B>`__, 
      and leave the Driver Station App main screen running all day without
      putting the device to sleep.  

   6. Keep the REV Driver Hub safe by using 3M Dual-Lock or hook-and-loop
      fasteners (like those sold by Velcro Brand) to mount the Driver Hub to
      a `Driver Station Carrier
      <https://www.andymark.com/products/18-in-driver-station-tray>`__. This
      prevents your REV Driver Hub from being placed on the floor (where team
      members may step on it) and prevents you from accidentally dropping the
      Driver Hub on the floor - dropping the Driver Hub is the #1 cause of all
      Driver Hub damage! Some teams have designed their own 
      `custom <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3386378>`__
      `Driver <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5439041>`__
      `Station <https://www.facebook.com/TeamWolfCorp/photos/a.1627476360819953/3028421417392100/?type=3>`__
      `Carriers <https://jmhannon.myportfolio.com/ftc-driver-station>`__, 
      be creative and have fun!  

   7. When the REV Driver Hub is not in use (not at competitions, not in use
      during practices) it should be turned OFF and have all sources of
      power disconnected. Do not put the Driver Hub to sleep, but actually
      turn it off - press the power button for 1-2 seconds and then use the
      drop-down menu to turn off the device. The Driver Hub uses power even
      in sleep mode, and that can lead to a dead battery and you may have to
      perform `Battery Lockout Recovery
      <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/driver-hub-troubleshooting/driver-hub-battery-troubleshooting#battery-lockout-recovery>`__
      before you can turn it back on.
      
   8. Sometimes teams may experience “random power loss” on the REV Driver
      Hub. This is usually due to a battery fitment issue within the battery
      box on the device (the battery momentarily stops making a connection
      with the power pins on the device), and can be mitigated using
      `techniques
      <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/driver-hub-troubleshooting#option-1-tape-quick-fix>`__
      from the REV Troubleshooting tips. Some teams have been known to operate
      their REV Driver Hubs without a battery inserted at all, and simply run
      the Driver Hub using a fully-charged USB Battery Pack, like the `Anker
      10,000mA Power Bank
      <https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B>`__.
      The jury is still out on whether that’s a good idea, but worth
      considering if you’re having problems that you’re desperate to solve and
      REV Support is unable to help you resolve (because of time pressures)
      before your big event.
      
   9. Ensure your REV Driver Hub is fully updated. Firmware 1.2.0 solves a
      host of REV Driver Hub issues, and it makes sense to use the on-board
      updater (once connected to Wi-Fi) to perform all updates on the Driver
      Hub.  

   10. This isn’t specifically a REV Driver Hub tip, but it’s a question we get
       asked all the time. Did you know that the Robot Wi-Fi network name
       (Robot Controller Name) and the Wi-Fi passwords can be managed
       straight from within the Driver Station app? With the Driver Station
       App connected via Wi-Fi to the Robot Controller, click on the three
       dots menu on the upper-right and select “Program and Manage”, then
       use the hamburger menu on the upper-left and select “Manage”. On this
       page you’ll find all of the same settings as you’d find on the
       webpage by logging in to the controller on a laptop!

.. dropdown:: Week of 06/10/2024 "Updating the SDK Manifest"
   :open: 

   .. sdkmanifest:

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week comes to us from an amalgamation of emailed
   questions asking about allowed ways to update an FtcRobotController SDK
   project. An approximate summary of the emailed questions along this topic is
   as follows:

   - *“Is merely editing the Android Manifest file in the TeamCode directory of
     the FtcRobotController SDK project an acceptable way of easily updating the
     SDK? And would this violate RS08 in Game Manual Part 1?”*

   Manually editing the Android Manifest file in the TeamCode Directory of the
   FtcRobotController SDK software is not a violation of RS08, merely because
   RS08(b) only protects the binary .AAR files. The manifest file is not part
   of the .AAR binary, and thus it’s not protected.

   Even though it’s not forbidden, that doesn’t mean you should do it – like
   putting pineapple on pizza (sorry, the door was open, I couldn’t stop
   myself). Seriously, though, 4 times out of 5 you can likely get away with
   updating the SDK through editing the Android Manifest to point to the latest
   version of the SDK libraries. However, that assumes that all the Tech Team
   does is update the SDK libraries, which is never ever the case. In addition
   to also updating programming samples, often enough the Tech Team must also
   update tooling, dependencies, and other build items in addition to the SDK
   libraries, and simply updating the Android Manifest is going to get you into
   real trouble (things will appear to work, until they don’t, and you won’t
   know why). As a corollary, you can choose to simply only put gas in your car
   and ignore all the other fluids, but eventually you’re going to wish you
   hadn’t.

   The proper way of updating your SDK is to use Git/GitHub to update your
   robot source each time the SDK software updates. The Tech Team always
   updates the FtcRobotController in-place (meaning the same repo is always
   updated each version), so if you’re using Git you can easily pull the
   changes made upstream and accept the changes within your code. You should
   never be manually updating files, like the Android Manifest file, because
   Git can tell you all of the files you need to update and can do that for
   you. If you use Git or GitHub, we highly recommend reading our guide on
   ftc-docs for :ref:`managing your Android Studio project repositories
   <programming_resources/tutorial_specific/android_studio/fork_and_clone_github_repository/Fork-and-Clone-From-GitHub:forks vs. clones>`.  

   For example, check out these changelists. The `FtcRobotController v9.0
   <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/pull/674/files>`__
   commit/change is everything that needs to be changed to upgrade from version
   8.2 to 9.0 – there are 75 changed files there, which include samples, a core
   interface module change, gradle dependencies, and in that changelist the
   Tech Team also rearchitected the asset structure. However, the
   `FtcRobotController v9.0.1
   <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/pull/731/files>`__
   and `FtcRobotController v9.1
   <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/pull/941/files>`__
   pull requests only changed a handful of files (mostly samples), and the core
   changes are in the AndroidManifest.xml and build.dependencies.gradle files.
   In general our major version releases (where we increase the first number in
   the version string) are the big ones, and then the dot-releases are almost
   always fairly small targeted releases. The Tech Team tries very hard not to
   make big-scale changes to build systems or major dependencies during the
   season.  In summary, teams should never simply change the Android Manifest,
   they should be updating the software appropriately – as Voltaire warned,
   with great “Android Studio” power comes great “GitHub” responsibility.
