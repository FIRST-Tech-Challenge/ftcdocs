*FIRST* Tech Challenge Tech Tips
================================

Started in the 2023-2024 season, Tech Tips are a weekly segment released in the
*FIRST* Tech Challenge `Team E-mail Blast
<https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/team-blast-archive>`__.
Sometimes the Tech Tips are included in whole in the email blast, but sometimes
there is more content than is reasonable in the email blast so partial content
is included in the blast with the rest of the content here. Blasts are ordered
on this page chronologically, with the newest content at the bottom of the page.

.. dropdown:: Week of 09/04/2023 "Battery Charging"

   The *FIRST* Tech Challenge Tech Tip of the week this week is all about Battery
   Charging. There are :ref:`three robot main batteries
   <control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr:robot main battery>` 
   that are legal to use in FIRST Tech Challenge, and they are all
   3000mAh NiMH batteries with an attached 20A fuse. However, the manufacturers
   of the batteries have different battery chargers and different recommended
   charging settings for the batteries. When charging the `TETRIX MAX 12-Volt
   battery
   <https://www.pitsco.com/TETRIX-12-Volt-Rechargeable-NiMH-Battery-Pack>`__,
   on the battery the manufacturer recommends charging at the 0.9A charge rate
   (the lowest setting on most selectable battery chargers) using the `Global
   NiMH battery pack charger
   <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__.  The `Matrix
   12-Volt battery
   <https://www.gobilda.com/matrix-12v-3000mah-nimh-battery/>`__ with the same
   form factor is recommended to be charged with the `goBILDA 12V battery
   charger <https://www.gobilda.com/battery-charger-nicad-nimh-12-1/>`__, which
   does not have a user-selectable charge rate switch but has a max charge rate
   of 1.0A.  However, the `REV 12-Volt Slim Battery
   <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1302/>`__ is recommended to be charged
   with the `REV Battery Charger <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1299/>`__
   using the 1.8A charge rate setting. To ensure safety, proper charging, and a
   long battery life, make sure you’re charging your batteries at the
   manufacturer’s recommended charge rates!

.. dropdown:: Week of 09/11/2023 "Updating the Robot Controller App"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the week is all about updating software on your
   Control Hub. If you use :ref:`Android Studio
   <programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial:android studio programming tutorial>`, 
   did you know that you’re not supposed to use the `REV Hardware Client
   <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__ to update the Robot
   Controller (RC) App? Blocks and OnBot Java programs are stored on the Robot
   Controller (SmartPhone or Control Hub) differently than Android Studio
   programs, and this has a major effect on how updates can be managed on the
   device. Read more about this at :ref:`Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App
   <ftc_sdk/updating/rc_app/Updating-the-RC-App:Updating the Robot Controller (RC) App>`.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/16/2023 "Battery Maintenance Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is an extension to our first-ever Tech Tip
   of the Week regarding battery maintenance. Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH or
   Ni-MH) batteries, like those used in FIRST Tech Challenge, do require
   periodic maintenance to keep them healthy! Every day, NiMH batteries lose on
   average 1% of their charge capacity at normal room temperature - at colder
   temperatures this decline slows a bit but does not stop it. This means that
   every 2-3 months it’s important to recharge your batteries to keep them
   healthy - there is no off-season for batteries! It’s also recommended to
   mark your batteries with tape and a sharpie to mark (1) Your team number
   (never lose a battery at a competition!), (2) What year the battery was
   purchased, (3) Give your batteries names so you can differentiate batteries
   easily, and (4) optionally provide a tick mark each time the battery is
   recharged. NiMH batteries can generally last 200-300 recharge cycles before
   their internal resistance declines to the point where it’s time to replace
   them, and keeping track of charge cycles is an easy way to track how “used”
   the battery is before needing to have its internal resistance checked.

.. dropdown:: Week of 10/23/2023 "Control and Expansion Hub Tips"

   This week’s Tech Tip of the Week provides useful tips when using Control and
   Expansion Hubs.  

   - The RS485 data cable ports that provide data between Control and Expansion
     Hubs are redundant - you can use two data cables utilizing both ports to
     ensure that if one cable fails communications aren’t lost.  

   - Encoder ports 0 and 3 are hardware-counted, but ports 1 and 2 are
     software-counted. This means higher counts-per-revolution encoders (like
     the REV Through-Bore Encoder) should be placed on Ports 0 or 3 to ensure
     counts aren’t missed, and lower counts-per-revolution encoders (like the
     goBILDA Odometry Pods or most motors) can be connected to any port.  
   
   - Servo port pairs (0,1), (2, 3), and (4,5) each share a common power
     supply, so if you’re using higher-current servos (like a goBILDA torque
     servo) directly on the Control or Expansion Hub you should only use ports
     (0, 2, 4) or (1, 3, 5) in order to maximize the power available to each
     servo. If you need to use more than 3 high-current servos per hub,
     consider using a `REV Servo Power Module
     <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1144/>`__.  

   - Each Digital and Analog sensor connector on the Control and Expansion Hub
     each have 2 signal channels. Some REV sensors are only designed to be
     configured and used on the N or N+1 channels. Read the documentation for
     each sensor carefully!  

   - The USB 2.0 port shares the same USB bus as the internal Control Hub
     radio. ESD or other electrical interference that affects devices (like
     webcams) plugged into that port may cause a loss of communications. When
     using a USB webcam, use the USB 3.0 port first.  

   - USB C-to-C cables do not work properly with the Control Hub, only USB
     A-to-C cables do.  

   - If you’re utilizing the onboard IMU, Do not plug I2C devices into Port 0
     unless absolutely necessary. Port 0 shares an I2C bus with the IMU, and
     misbehaving devices (or devices that don’t “play well with others”)
     plugged into Port 0 can cause the IMU to stop communicating.
