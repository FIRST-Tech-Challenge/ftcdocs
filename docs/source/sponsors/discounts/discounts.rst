FIRST Tech Challenge Team Discounts
===================================

As a benefit of being a FIRST Tech Challenge Team, some vendors and sponsors of
*FIRST* programs have generously provided discounts on products to teams.
These discounts may be for specific categories of products, or may apply
site-wide, and may require an application process or a season-specific or
team-specific promo code. Read details below for each vendor for more
information.
