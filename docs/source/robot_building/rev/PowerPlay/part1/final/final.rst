-  You have now constructed the frame of your Basic ‘Bot, however,
   programming will be needed to make the robot functional.

-  Testing should be done to determine whether anything needs to be
   changed or optimized for the season’s game rules. Testing will also
   show whether more cables need to be secured or re-routed.

-  Check the game rules for all the applicable stickers
