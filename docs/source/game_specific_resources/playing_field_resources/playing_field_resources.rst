About the Playing Field

There are multiple configurations of the playing field that can be used. For traditional games, the playing field is a part of the Competition Area that includes the 12 ft. x 12 ft. (3.66 m x 3.66 m) field and all
the elements described in the official field drawings. For remote games, the playing field is a part of the Competition Area that includes the 12 ft. x 8 ft. (3.66 m x 2.44 m) field and all the elements described 
in the official field drawings. The base field stays the same for all games but the game elements are subject to change as per :ref:`Game Manual Part 2<manuals/game_manuals/game_manuals:game manuals>`.
