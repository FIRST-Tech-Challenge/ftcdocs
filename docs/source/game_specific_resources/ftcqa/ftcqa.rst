FIRST Tech Challenge Game Q&A
=============================

The `Game Q&A <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/>`_ is a forum/tool that
provides teams an opportunity to receive clarifications from the Game Design
Committee about the current season's challenge. Rulings on the Q&A are final
and binding, so all teams must make sure to check back and review the Q&A
often. Game rulings made within the Q&A system are NOT guaranteed to be
reflected in the appropriate Game Manual.

How to Ask Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the `Game Q&A <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/>`_ opens for the season
(usually within 2-3 weeks of the challenge being announced) teams may ask
questions using unique accounts provided to teams via their 
`FIRST Dashboard <https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`_ accounts. Teams
must use these credentials to log into the system, and then may ask questions.
Anyone may create a personal account and view or tag questions, but only
accounts provided to teams may ask questions.

Obtaining the team credentials for the question-asking team accounts can only
be done by the Lead Coach 1 or 2 by selecting "Passwords/Voucher Codes" from
the "Payment & Product" drop-down in the "Team Options" column of the team
information in the `FIRST Dashboard <https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`_.  
The Q&A website credentials for the team will be listed under the "Game Q&A
Forum Accounts" section of the resulting webpage.
 
Game Q&A Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Game Q&A tool periodically provides updates to their 
"`one-page summary <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/onepage.html>`_" of all
answered questions. This one-page summary is not guaranteed to contain all
questions and answers, and is also not guaranteed to be updated on a regular
basis, but it is the best way to obtain a printable format of the questions and
answers on the forum.
