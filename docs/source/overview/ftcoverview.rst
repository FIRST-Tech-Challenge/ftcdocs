.. comment: the roles are converted into CSS Class names that we can target with CSS. 
   :wordmark: is used to italicize the FIRST word.
   :superscript: will superscript anything but was intended for Registered and Copyright symbols.
   Replace all *FIRST* with |FIRST|. this uses CSS instead of <em> to italicize FIRST. This avoids spoken word pauses that surround <em> text.
   We can also use the substitutions and a role to superscript the Registered symbol.
   We add a FTC subsitution for future convienience, no need to replaces existing text.
   We add |FIRST-reg| and |FTC-reg| substitutions which can be used to add the registered mark to the first use of FIRST or FTC in body text as per FIRST branding.
   Don't use the registered mark in the document heading because the Registered mark will get imbedded in all links including the sidebar and we'd have registered marks everywhere.

About the |FIRST| Tech Challenge
====================================

It’s way more than building robots. |FTC-reg| teams (up to 15 team
members, grades 7 to 12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate
robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.

Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop :abbr:`STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)` skills and practice
engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and
working as a team.

The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of
levels of graphical and Java-based programming. Teams design and build robots,
raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to
earn specific awards. Participants are encouraged to explore future education,
enlistment, and other employment pathways.

   Build the FIRST Championship link so we can italicize FIRST.

Teams compete at regional events leading up to an exciting |text|_ that concludes the season.

Start a |FIRST| Tech Challenge Team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|FTC| teams design and build a robot using a reusable kit of
parts and compete within a common set of game rules to play an exciting field
game and complete the specific season challenge. The robot game changes every
season and is always a blast!

Student and adult team members are encouraged to bring any skills they already
have, like programming, electronics, metalworking, graphic design, web
creation, public speaking, videography, and many more. |FIRST| Tech Challenge
welcomes every student, with or without special skills.

If you are looking to incorporate |FIRST| into your classroom or after-school
programming, learn more about |classpack|_, a flexible implementation
option for up to 24 students.
