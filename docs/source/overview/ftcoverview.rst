About the *FIRST* Tech Challenge
================================

It’s way more than building robots. *FIRST* Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team
members, grades 7-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate
robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.

Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice
engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and
working as a team.

The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of
levels of graphical and Java-based programming. Teams design and build robots,
raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to
earn specific awards. Participants are encouraged to explore future education,
enlistment, and other employment pathways.

Start a *FIRST* Tech Challenge Team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*FIRST* Tech Challenge teams design and build a robot using a reusable kit of
parts and compete within a common set of game rules to play an exciting field
game and complete the specific season challenge. The robot game changes every
season and is always a blast!

Student and adult team members are encouraged to bring any skills they already
have, like programming, electronics, metalworking, graphic design, web
creation, public speaking, videography, and many more. *FIRST* Tech Challenge
welcomes every student, with or without special skills.

If you are looking to incorporate *FIRST* into your classroom or after-school
programming, learn more about *FIRST* Class Pack, a flexible implementation
option for up to 24 students.
