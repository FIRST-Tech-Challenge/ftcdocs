SOLIDWORKS® CAD Resources
=========================

For over 15 years, Dassault Systèmes has been a software supplier to *FIRST®*
teams with SOLIDWORKS®. We are also introducing the 3DEXPERIENCE®
platform, a technology platform that provides Product Lifecycle Management
(PLM), collaboration, community, and Cloud CAD Apps to all *FIRST* teams. Enhance
collaborative robot design with your team.

Obtaining SOLIDWORKS® Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dassault Systèmes makes software available to all *FIRST* teams via the *FIRST*
`SOLIDWORKS Desktop & SOLIDWORKS Cloud Sponsorship Page <https://www.solidworks.com/product/students/first-robotics-students>`__.

Dassault Systèmes provides both cloud-based and desktop-based tools to *FIRST*
teams. Teams must:

1.  `Create a 3DEXPERIENCE ID <https://eu1-ds-iam.3dexperience.3ds.com/login>`__
    if you don't have one.
2.  `Apply to request your license <https://www.solidworks.com/product/students/get-your-license>`__.

SOLIDWORKS® Training Videos

Learning content for both the cloud-based and desktop-based tools is managed
through the `3DS online learning portal <https://edu.3ds.com/en/learn/eduspace>`__,
which manages access through your 3DEXPERIENCE ID.
