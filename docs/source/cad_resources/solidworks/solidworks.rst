SOLIDWORKS® CAD Resources
=========================

For over 15 years, Dassault Systèmes has been a software supplier to *FIRST®*
teams with SOLIDWORKS®. We are also introducing the 3DEXPERIENCE®
platform, a technology platform that provides Product Lifecycle Management
(PLM), collaboration, community, and Cloud CAD Apps to all *FIRST* teams. Enhance
collaborative robot design with your team.

Obtaining SOLIDWORKS® Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dassault Systèmes makes select software available to all *FIRST* teams. 

.. note:: As of the 2022-2023 season, Dassault Systèmes is changing their software application process. **More Details to be announced by Kickoff**. All teams who would like to request software should create a 3DEXPERIENCE ID regardless of whether you're requesting desktop or cloud-based software.

Dassault Systèmes provides both cloud-based and desktop-based tools to *FIRST*
teams. Teams must:

1.  `Create a 3DEXPERIENCE ID <https://eu1-ds-iam.3dexperience.3ds.com/login>`__
    if you don't have one.
2.  Apply to request your license (**more details coming soon**).

SOLIDWORKS® Training Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Learning content for both the cloud-based and desktop-based tools is managed
through the `3DS online learning portal <https://edu.3ds.com/en/learn/eduspace>`__,
which manages access through your 3DEXPERIENCE ID.
