CAD Resources
=============

`Computer Aided Design (CAD)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design>`__ and 3D animation
software is used in *FIRST* Tech Challenge by teams to design and visualize
complex systems prior to manufacturing. There are many software options for CAD 
and there's no way to list them all. Some software is provided free of charge, 
some software is provided for a fee, and some require subscriptions. However, many organizations provide free 
access to "premium" CAD software to *FIRST* teams.

When looking for a CAD package, consider what computers the software will run on. Some CAD
packages are desktop solutions and require a fairly competent computer with ample resources
to run. Some CAD suppliers also provide cloud-based tools, which move the processing load
onto cloud servers - these solutions often merely require an internet-connected computer 
with a web browser.

Here are a few tools commonly used by teams:
