List of ToDo items:

#. Update the Complimentary Software page: Monday.com will be recording their webinar on September 12.
   After the webinar we need to update the text to remove the webinar registration information and add
   a link to the recorded webinar.
   
#. Once Solidworks updates their team software registration process, we need to add instructions on
   how to get the voucher code from the voucher system and provide that code to Solidworks for them
   to credit the team with the software license.
   
#. Create video tutorial page to include all FIRST created videos, but also provide the community with
   a way to recommend video tutorials to include on the page. Need to develop a "standards" document to 
   provide guidance on what kinds and quality of the videos we expect, as well as the hosting method
   (so that videos can't be swapped with unacceptable media).
