Managing a Control Hub
======================

Changing the Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Control Hub has a name that begins with the phrase
"FTC-" and ends with four characters that are assigned at the factory.
In order to comply with game manual rule <RS01>, the name should be
changed.

The name of a Control Hub (or Robot Controller phone) can be changed
from a paired DS app, as shown in :ref:`Changing the Name<programming_resources/shared/managing_smartphone_rc/Managing-a-Smartphone-Robot-Controller:changing the name>`.

As an alternate, you can change the name of a Control Hub at the
*Manage* page from a connected Driver Station or laptop, as described
below. Click ``Apply Wi-Fi Settings`` when done.

.. important:: Changing the name of a Control Hub changes the name
   of the Hub's wireless network. Once the name is changed, you will have
   to connect your devices (Driver Station and programming laptop) to the
   new network.

Changing the Name of a Control Hub
----------------------------------

1. Verify that your laptop or Chromebook is connected to the Program & Manage wireless network of the Control Hub. If you are connected to the network, you should be able to see the *Robot Controller Connection Info* page when you navigate to address "192.168.43.1:8080":

Changing the Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Control Hub has its password set to password at the
factory. It is a good idea to change the password from its default value
before you begin using your Control Hub.

You can change the password of a Control Hub using a laptop or
Chromebook that is connected to the Hub's Program & Management page.

.. warning:: Commit your new password to memory or store it in a
   secure location so you will not forget it. You will need this password
   to manage and operate your Control Hub. Also note, once the password has
   been changed, you will have to reconnect your devices (Driver Station
   and programming laptop/Chromebook) to the network using the new
   password.

Changing the Password of a Control Hub
--------------------------------------

1. On the *Manage* page of the Control Hub user interface, find specify your new password and then confirm this new password in the *Access Point Password* section of the page. Press the *Change Password* to change the password.

Resetting a Control Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you forget the network name or password for a Control Hub, you can
reset the Hub's name and password back to their factory default values.

.. important:: Resetting a Control Hub will restore its default
   network name and password. However, existing configuration files and op
   modes should not be affected by the reset. This includes op modes that
   were created using the Blocks, OnBot Java and Android Studio tools.

Resetting Instructions
-----------------------

1. Turn off the power to your Control Hub for 5 seconds.
2. Press and hold the button on the Control Hub (see image below).

.. image:: images/controlHubButton.jpg
   :align: center

|

3. Power on the Control Hub while continuing to hold the button. Monitor the LED while the Control Hub is rebooting. Eventually, the LED will switch from being solid blue, to a multi-color blink pattern.

   When the reset has started, the LED should blink purple, yellow, blue, and then red. This pattern should occur five times in rapid succession. 
   
   Once the multi-colored blink pattern is complete, you can release the button. The Control Hub's network name and password should be restored to their factory values. Note that the reboot and reset process should take approximately 30 seconds to complete.

Changing the WiFi Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Control Hub acts as a wireless access point for the Driver Station
and for the programming laptop or Chromebook. By default the Control Hub
automatically picks an operating WiFi channel. However, it is sometimes
necessary to specify the operating channel for the Hub.

For example, at a large competition an FTA might ask that you switch to
a designated channel to avoid wireless interference that is present in
the venue. Similarly, an FTA might ask you to switch to a specific
channel because the FTA is monitoring that designated channel for
interference or other wireless disruptions.

You can select the operating channel for the Control Hub from the
*Manage* page.

Changing the WiFi Channel Instructions
--------------------------------------

1. On the *Manage* page of the Control Hub user interface, use the drop down selector to select the desired operating channel. Note that the Control Hub supports both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Updating the Expansion Hub Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Control Hub has its own built-in REV Robotics Expansion Hub. The
purpose of the Expansion Hub board is to facilitate communication
between the Control Hub's Android controller and the motors, servos, and
sensors of the robot. Periodically, REV Robotics will release new
versions of the firmware which contains fixes and improvements for the
Expansion Hub. The firmware releases are in the form of a binary
(.bin) file.

The `REV Hardware Client <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`__
software can update the firmware for the Control Hub's embedded
Expansion Hub.

As an alternate, you can use the *Manage* interface from a connected
laptop or Driver Station (DS) app to upload a Control Hub's firmware, or
to update it using the included or uploaded version. New firmware images
can be obtained from the `REV Robotics website <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/managing-the-control-system/updating-firmware#using-the-robot-controller-console>`__.

Also, included or uploaded Control Hub firmware can be updated in Robot
Controller Advanced Settings, from a paired Driver Station (DS) app as
shown below.

These three methods do not apply to updating the firmware of an
Expansion Hub connected to a Control Hub via RS485 data wire. Standalone

Connecting to the Control Hub Using Wireless ADB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced users who use Android Studio to build and install the Robot
Controller app onto their Control Hub should be familiar with the
Android Debug Bridge (adb) utility. adb is included with the Android
development platform tools. It can be used to communicate with an
Android device such as the Control Hub.

Traditionally, programmers use a hard-wired USB connection to
communicate using adb to their Android device. adb also supports a mode
where commands are sent back and forth through a wireless connection.

The Control Hub is configured so that it automatically will support an
adb wireless connection request on port 5555.

Connecting to the Control Hub Using Wireless ADB Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Verify that your laptop is connected to the Program & Manage
wireless network of the Control Hub. If you are connected to the
network, you should be able to see the *Robot Controller Connection
Info* page when you navigate to address "192.168.43.1:8080":

.. image:: images/aboutRobotControllerNewOSVersion.jpg
   :align: center

|

   If your laptop is not connected and you are unable to access the *Robot Controller Connection Info* page, then read the instructions in the following tutorial (Connecting-a-Laptop-to-the-Program-&-Manage-Network) to learn how to connect to the Program & Manage network.

   :doc:`Connecting a laptop to the Program & Manage Network <../program_and_manage_network/Connecting-a-Laptop-to-the-Program-&-Manage-Network>`

2. Verify that the PATH environment variable for your Windows
computer includes the path to the adb.exe executable file. The
`Android Developer website <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb>`__
tells you where in your Android SDK installation you can find the
adb.exe file. This
`post <https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/>`__
from
`HelpDeskGeek.com <https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/>`__
shows how to add a directory to your Windows PATH environment
variable.

3. Open a Windows Command Prompt and type in "adb.exe connect 192.168.43.1:5555". This should connect your adb server to the Control Hub over the wireless connection.
