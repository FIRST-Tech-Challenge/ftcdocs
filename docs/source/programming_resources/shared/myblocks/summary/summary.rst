Summary: Benefits of myBlocks
=============================

1. MyBlocks now provide access to the full range of Java in the 
   Software Development Kit (SDK). Blocks programming can now perform
   tasks **previously unavailable** to Blocks-only teams. This now
   includes :ref:`External
   Libraries <programming_resources/shared/external_libraries_blocks/external-libraries-blocks:external 
   libraries in onbot java and blocks>`.

2. MyBlocks can neatly package previously **long or complex Functions**
   in Blocks.

3. MyBlocks programming allows some team members to begin learning and
   using Java, contributing valuable new features. The other team
   members can continue learning and working in Blocks, producing the
   team’s official code. Nobody is held back, or left behind.

4. MyBlocks can be created with **OnBot Java**, which runs on the RC
   phone or Control Hub. Building and testing are very fast. Many 
   teams do not have easy access to Android Studio, for reasons
   including school computers that prevent software installation.

5. By developing and sharing myBlocks, experienced teams could **help new
   teams** in a more direct way, beyond simply posting a link to their Java
   library. The *FIRST* Tech Challenge community might ultimately benefit from
   a curated repository for tested, well documented myBlocks.  Perhaps the
   “Blocks Store”?
