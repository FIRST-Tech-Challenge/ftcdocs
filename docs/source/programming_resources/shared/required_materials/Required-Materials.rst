   * - A REV Robotics Control Hub to be used as a ROBOT CONTROLLER.
       Alternately, the Competition Manual does allow teams to instead
       use a REV Robotics Expansion Hub and a select list of Android
       phones.

   * - A REV Robotics Driver Hub to be used as a DRIVER STATION device.
       Alternately, the Competition Manual does allow teams to instead
       use a select list of Android phones. See rule R901 for the full
       details.

   * - Wireless Internet access.
     - |wifi|

   * - Laptop with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 or 11 and Wi-Fi capability. Note that your laptop should have the most current service packs and system updates from Microsoft. If you are using a different type of machine (such as a Chromebook, Android Tablet, etc.) as your programming device, the steps might differ slightly on how to access the Programming Server on the Robot Controller. Refer to your deviceâ€™s user documentation for details on how to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
     - |laptop|

   * - Javascript-enabled web browser (Google Chrome is the recommended browser).
     - |chrome|

   * - REV Robotics Switch, Cable, & Bracket (REV-31-1387).
     - |switch|
  
   * - *FIRST*-approved\* 12V Battery (such as Tetrix W39057 or REV Robotics REV-31-1302).\*\ **For a list of FIRST-approved 12V batteries, refer to the current Competition Manual.**\
     - |battery|   Or |slimbattery|

   * - *FIRST*-approved\* 12V DC Motor (such as Tetrix W39530, with power cable W41352).\*\ **For a list of FIRST-approved 12V motors, refer to the current Competition Manual.**\
     - |motor|


   * - If you are using an approved 12V battery that has a Tamiya connector (like the Tetrix W39057 battery) you will need a REV Robotics Tamiya to XT30 Adapter Cable (REV-31-1382). If you have a REV Robotics Slim Battery (REV-31-1302) then you will not need this adapter since the REV battery already has an XT30 connector.
