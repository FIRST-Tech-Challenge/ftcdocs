Using Your Android Device
=========================

Before you get started with your control system, it is helpful if you
familiarize yourself with the basic operation of your Android device.

Unlocking Your Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first power on an Android phone, it usually starts off with the
screen in a "locked" state. For the Motorola smartphones that are used
in the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, you must touch the locked screen and then
slide your finger upwards along the screen to unlock the phone. Note
that different devices might require a slightly different procedure to
unlock the screen.

Depending on your security settings, you might be challenged for a pass
code or PIN number. Use the touch screen to enter in the pass code or
PIN value and tap on the check mark to log into the device.

Navigating in Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your phone should display its home screen if you just powered it on and
unlocked it. Note that the actual screens on your smartphone might
differ slightly from the screens depicted in this tutorial.

At the bottom of the screen there should be some buttons that you can
use to navigate the screens on your Android device.

The leftmost button (see image above) is the "Back" button. You can use
this button to return to the previous screen on your Android device.

The center button is the "Home" button. Pressing this button should take
you back to the home or opening screen of your Android device.

The rightmost button is the "Recent Apps" button. If you click on this
button it will display the apps that were recently run and are dormant
in the background. You can close a recent app by tapping the "X" button
on the app's listing.

Note that some Android smartphones have an auto-hide feature which
automatically hides the bottom navigation buttons. If your smartphone
has this feature, you might need to swipe up from the bottom of the
screen to display the navigation buttons.

Displaying Available Apps on your Android Phone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android Marshmallow Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using a device with Android Marshmallow (6.x) or earlier, you
can display the available apps using the *Android App Drawer* button
that is available on the home screen.

There should be another row of buttons visible above the "Back", "Home"
and "Recent Apps" buttons. In the center of this row of buttons is a
button that has an array of dots or squares.

Tapping on this button will launch the *Android App Drawer*. The App
Drawer displays a list of all of the apps that are available on your
Android device. You can scroll through the App Drawer screens to find
and launch an app.

Android Nougat Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using a device with Android Nougat (7.x) or newer, you can
display the available apps by simply swiping upwards from the bottom of
the touchscreen. Newer versions of Android no longer have the *App
Drawer* feature.
