Using Sensors :bdg-warning:`Blocks`
===================================

Color-Distance Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sensor is a device that lets the Robot Controller get information
about its environment. In this example, you will use a REV Robotics
Color-Distance sensor to display range (distance from an object) info to
the driver station.

The Color-Range sensor uses reflected light to determine the distance
from the sensor to the target object. It can be used to measure close
distances (up 5" or more) with reasonable accuracy. Note that at the
time this document was most recently edited, the REV Color-Range sensor
saturates around 2" (5cm). This means that for distances less than or
equal to 2", the sensor returns a measured distance equal to 2" or so.

Note that it will take an estimated 15 minutes to complete this task.

Modifying the Op Mode to Display Distance Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

1. Verify that your laptop is still connected to the Robot            
Controller's Program & Manage Wi-Fi network.                          

2. Verify that "MyFIRSTOpMode" is opened for editing. If it is not,   
you can click on the FIRST logo in the upper left hand corner of the  
browser window on the laptop. This should take you to the main 
Blocks Development Tool project screen.

   Click on the "MyFIRSTOpMode" project to open it for editing if it is not already opened.

3. Click on the "Utilities" category on the left-hand side of your    
browser. Find and click on the "Telemetry" subcategory.

4. Select the "call telemetry.addData" block (the numeric version)    
and drag it to the spot in your "while" loop block immediately before 
the "telemetry.update" block.

5. Click and highlight the "key" text and change the text so it reads 
"Distance (cm)".

6. Click and expand the "Sensors" category. Click on the "REV         
Color/Range Sensor" subcategory. Click on and select the "call        
sensorColorRange.getDistance" programming block.                      

.. image:: images/DistanceSensorStep6ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   Note that earlier versions of the Blocks Programming tool refer to the REV Robotics Color-Distance Sensor as the "LynxI2cColorRangeSensor".  Newer versions of the software refer to the device as the "REV Color/Range Sensor".

7. Drag the "call sensorColorRange.getDistance" programming block to  
the "number" field of the "call telemetry.addData" programming block. 

.. image:: images/DistanceSensorStep7ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   This will send the measured distance to the target in centimeters back to the Driver Station.

8. Save your op mode and verify that it was saved successfully to the 
Robot Controller.                                                     

.. image:: images/DistanceSensorStep8ControlHub.jpg

9. Follow the procedure outlined in the section titled :doc:`Running Your  
OpMode <../running_op_modes/Running-Your-Op-Mode>` 
to run your updated op mode.                                          

.. image:: images/DistanceSensorStep9ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   As you run the op mode, if you move your hand above the color light sensor, you should see the measured distance change on the Driver Station screen.  If the expression "NaN" (not a number) is displayed on the Driver Station, the target is most likely out of range (and the sensor does not detect any reflected light).

Touch Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this example, we assume that the REV Robotics Touch Sensor has been
configured as a digital touch sensor in the Robot Controller's active
configuration file. We will use the "isPressed" programming block to
determine if the button on the sensor is currently pressed or not.

The Expansion Hub digital ports contain two digital pins per port. When
you use a 4-wire JST cable to connect a REV Robotics Touch sensor to an
Expansion Hub digital port, the Touch Sensor is wired to the second of
the two digital pins within the port. The first digital pin of the
4-wire cable remains disconnected.

For example, if you connect a Touch Sensor to the "0,1" digital port of
the Expansion Hub, the Touch Sensor will be connected to the second pin
(labeled "1") of the port. The first pin (labeled "0") will stay
disconnected.

Note that it will take an estimated 15 minutes to complete this task.

Modifying the Op Mode to Display Button (Touch Sensor) State Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Verify that your laptop is still connected to the Robot            
Controller's Programming Mode Wi-Fi network.                          

2. Verify that "MyFIRSTOpMode" is opened for editing. If it is not,   
you can click on the FIRST logo in the upper left hand corner of the  
browser window on the laptop. This should take you to the main 
Blocks Development Tool project screen.

   Click on the "MyFIRSTOpMode" project to open it for editing if it is not already opened.

3. Click on the "Logic" category. Find and click on the "if do else"  
block.

4. Drag the "if do else" block to the position before the             
"telemetry.update" block.

5. Click on the "Sensors" category to expand it (if it isn't already  
expanded). Click on the "Touch Sensor" subcategory, then find and     
select the ".isPressed" block.

6. Drag the "isPressed" block to the test condition of the "if do     
else" programming block.                                              

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep6ControlHub.jpg

7. Click on the "Utilities" category on the left-hand side of your    
browser. Find and click on the "Telemetry" subcategory.               

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep7ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   Select the "call telemetry.addData" block (the text version) and drag it to the "do" clause of the "if do else" block.

8. Change the "key" value to "testTouch" and the "text" value to "is  
pressed".                                                             

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep8ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

9. Insert another "telemetry.addData" block (the text version) to the 
"else" clause of the "if do else" block. Change the "key" value to    
"testTouch" and the "text" value to "is NOT pressed".                 

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep9ControlHub.jpg

10. Save your op mode and verify that it was saved successfully to    
the Robot Controller.                                                 

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep10ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

11. Follow the procedure outlined in the section titled :doc:`Running Your 
OpMode <../running_op_modes/Running-Your-Op-Mode>`
to run your updated op mode.                                          

.. image:: images/TouchSensorOpModeStep11ControlHub.jpg

   As you run the op mode and push or release the button, the telemetry message on the Driver Station should update to reflect the current state of the digital Touch Sensor.
