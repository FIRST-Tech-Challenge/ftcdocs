Controlling a Servo :bdg-warning:`Blocks`
=========================================

In the section titled :doc:`Creating an Op Mode with 
Blocks <../creating_op_modes/Writing-an-Op-Mode-with-FTC-Blocks>` you learned how to use
the Blocks Programming Tool to write an op mode that controls a 12V
DC motor. In this section, you will learn how to write an op mode that
controls a servo motor.

What is a Servo Motor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A servo motor is a special type of motor that is designed for precise
motion. A typical servo motor has a limited range of motion.

In the figure below, a "standard scale" 180-degree servo is shown. This
type of servo is popular with hobbyists and with FIRST Tech Challenge
teams. This servo motor can rotate its shaft through a range of 180
degrees. Using an electronic module known as a servo controller you can
write an op mode that will move a servo motor to a specific position.
Once the motor reaches this target position, it will hold the position,
even if external forces are applied to the shaft of the servo.

Servo motors are useful when you want to do precise movements (for
example, sweep an area with a sensor to look for a target or move the
control surfaces on a remotely controlled airplane).

Modifying Your Op Mode to Control a Servo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's modify your op mode to add the logic required to control a servo
motor. For this example, you will use the buttons on the Logitech F310
gamepad to control the position of the servo motor.

With a typical servo, you can specify a target position for the servo.
The servo will turn its motor shaft to move to the target position, and
then maintain that position, even if moderate forces are applied to try
and disturb its position.

For the blocks Program & Manage server, you can specify a target
position that ranges from 0 to 1 for a servo. A target position of 0
corresponds to zero degrees of rotation and a target position of 1
corresponds to 180 degrees of rotation for a typical servo motor.

In this example, you will use the colored buttons on the right side of
the F310 controller to control the position of the servo. Initially, the
op mode will move the servo to the midway position (90 degrees of its
180-degree range). Pushing the yellow "Y" button will move the servo to
the zero-degree position. Pushing the blue "X" button or the red "B"
button will move the servo to the 90-degree position. Pushing the green
"A" button will move the servo to the 180-degree position.

17. Drag the "and" block so it clicks in place as the test condition  
for the first "else if" block.                                        

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep17ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

18. Click on the word "and" and select "or" from the pop-up menu to   
change the block to a logical "or" block.                             

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep18ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

19. Click on the "Gamepad" category and select the "gamepad1.X"       
block. Drag the block so that it clicks in place as the first test    
condition of the logical "or" block.                                  

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep19ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

20. Click on the "Gamepad" category and select the "gamepad1.B"       
block. Drag the block so that it clicks in place as the second test   
condition of the logical "or" block.                                  

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep20ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

21. Select a "set servoTest.Position to" block and place it into "do" 
clause of the first else-if block.                                    

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep21ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

22. Highlight the number "0" and change it to "0.5". With this        
change, if the user presses the "X" button or "B" button on gamepad   
#1, the op mode will move the servo to the midway (90-degree)         
position.                                                             

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep22ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

23. Use a "gamepad1.A" block as the test condition for the second     
"else if" block. Drag a "set servoTest.position to" block to the do   
clause of the second "else if" block and modify the numeric value so  
that the servo's position will be set to a value of 1.                

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep23ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   For this clause, if the "A" button is pressed on the #1 gamepad, the op mode will move the servo to the 180-degree position.

24. Insert a "call telemetry.addData" block (numeric) before the      
"call Telemetry.update" block. Rename the key field to "Servo         
Position" and insert a "servoTest.Position" block for the number      
field.                                                                

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep24ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

   This set of blocks will send the current servo position value to the Driver Station while the op mode is running.

25. Save your op mode and verify that it was saved successfully to    
the Robot Controller.                                                 

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep25ControlHub.jpg
   :align: center

|

26. Follow the procedure outlined in the section titled :doc:`Running Your 
OpMode <../running_op_modes/Running-Your-Op-Mode>` 
to run your updated op mode. Also, make sure that your gamepad is     
designated as User #1 before running your op mode.                    

.. image:: images/ControlServoStep26ControlHub.jpg
