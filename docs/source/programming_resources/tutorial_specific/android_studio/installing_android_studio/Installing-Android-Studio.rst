Installing Android Studio
=========================

Android Developer Website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android Studio is distributed freely by Google, and the most up-to-date
reference for installing and using the Android Studio software can be
found on the Android developer website:

*  https://developer.android.com/studio

Android Studio is available on the Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating
systems.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you download and install the Android Studio you should first
check the list of system requirements on the Android developer's website
to verify that your system satisfies the list of minimum requirements:

*  `Windows <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#1>`__
*  `MacOS <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#3>`__
*  `Linux <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#5>`__

Java Development Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Earlier versions of Android Studio required that the user install the
Java Development Kit software separately. Current versions of Android
Studio incorporate the Java development software as part of the entire
install package. It is no longer necessary (or recommended) to install
the Java Development Kit separately. Instead, it is recommended that you
use the Java Development Kit that is included with Android Studio.

requirements, you can go to the Android developer's website to download
