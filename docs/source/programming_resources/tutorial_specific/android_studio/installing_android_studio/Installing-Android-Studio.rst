Installing Android Studio :bdg-success:`AS`
===========================================

Android Developer Website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android Studio is distributed freely by Google, and the most up-to-date
reference for installing and using the Android Studio software can be
found on the Android developer website:

*  https://developer.android.com/studio

Android Studio is available on the Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating
systems.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you download and install the Android Studio you should first
check the list of system requirements on the Android developer's website
to verify that your system satisfies the list of minimum requirements:

*  `Windows <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#1>`__
*  `MacOS <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#3>`__
*  `Linux <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#5>`__

Java Development Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Earlier versions of Android Studio required that the user install the
Java Development Kit software separately. Versions of Android
Studio up to, and including, Koala incorporate a compatible JDK (Java Development Kit)
as part of the entire install package. It is not necessary, or recommended, 
to install the Java Development Kit separately if you are using an Android Studio
version between Chipmunk and Koala. Instead, it is recommended that you
use the Java Development Kit that is included with Android Studio.

.. caution:: 

   With the introduction of **Android Studio Ladybug**, the JDK that is packaged with
   Android Studio is incompatible with the FtcRobotController workspace.  If you install
   or update an existing installation to Android Studio Ladybug, you will need to install
   JDK 17 separately.

   Upon initial load of the FtcRobotController workspace using Android Studio Ladybug, 
   an error will be displayed during the Gradle sync and Android Studio will recommend that
   you upgrade Gradle.  Do not upgrade Gradle.
