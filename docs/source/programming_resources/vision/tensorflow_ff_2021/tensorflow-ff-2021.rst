TensorFlow for FREIGHT FRENZY presented by Raytheon Technologies
================================================================

What is TensorFlow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*FIRST* Tech Challenge teams can use `TensorFlow
Lite <https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/>`__, a lightweight version of
Google’s `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`__ machine learning
technology that is designed to run on mobile devices such as an Android
smartphone. A *trained TensorFlow model* was developed to recognize game
elements for the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy challenge.

   This season’s TFOD model can recognize Freight elements

TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) has been integrated into the 
control system software, to identify and track these game pieces during
a match. The software (SDK version 7.0) contains TFOD Sample Op
Modes that can recognize the Freight elements Duck, Box (or Cube), and
Cargo (or Ball).

Also, teams can use a new tool to train their own TFOD models, to
recognize their custom Team Shipping Element (TSE) and/or to improve
recognition of Freight elements. This training could take into account
certain conditions of distance, angle, lighting and background.

This new tool is the **Machine Learning Toolchain**, `announced
10/7/2021 <http://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/2021/10/new-machine-learning-tool-beta-testing.html>`__.

How Might a Team Use TensorFlow in Freight Frenzy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this season’s challenge, during the pre-Match stage a single die is
rolled and the field is randomized.

   Randomization


At the beginning of the match’s Autonomous period, a robot can use
TensorFlow to “look” at the **Barcode** area and determine whether the
Duck or optional Team Shipping Element (TSE) is in position 1, 2 or 3.
This indicates the preferred scoring level on the **Alliance Shipping
Hub**. A bonus is available for using the TSE instead of a Duck.

Important Note on Phone Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow Lite runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher, a
requirement met by all currently allowed devices. If you are a
Blocks programmer using an older/disallowed Android device that is not
running Marshmallow or higher, TFOD Blocks will automatically be missing
from the Blocks toolbox or design palette.

Sample Op Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software (SDK version 7.0 and higher) contains sample Blocks and
Java op modes that demonstrate TensorFlow **recognition** of Freight
elements Duck, Box (cube) and Cargo (ball). The sample op modes also
show **where** in the camera’s field of view a detected object is
located.

Using a Custom Inference Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teams have the option of using a custom inference model with the FIRST
Tech Challenge software. As noted above, the **Machine Learning
toolchain** is a streamlined tool for training your own TFOD models. An
alternate would be to use the `TensorFlow Object Detection
API <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>`__
to create an enhanced model of the Freight elements or TSE, or to create
a custom model to detect other entirely different objects. Other teams
might also want to use an available pre-trained model to build a robot
that can detect common everyday objects (for demo or outreach purposes,
for example).

The software includes sample op modes (Blocks and Java versions)
that demonstrate how to use a **custom inference model**:

-  `Using a Custom TensorFlow Model with
   Blocks <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Using-a-Custom-TensorFlow-Model-with-Blocks>`__
-  `Using a Custom TensorFlow Model with
   Java <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Using-a-Custom-TensorFlow-Model-with-Java>`__

These tutorials use examples from a previous season (Skystone), but
the process remains generally valid for Freight Frenzy.

Detecting Everyday Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a pretrained TensorFlow Lite model to detect **everyday
objects**, such as a clock, person, computer mouse, or cell phone. The
following advanced tutorial shows how you can use a free, pretrained
model to recognize numerous everyday objects.

   Objects <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Using-a-TensorFlow-Pretrained-Model-to-Detect-Everyday-Objects>`__
