Webcam Controls
===============

This basic tutorial describes 8 webcam controls available in the 
SDK. It includes an example, using 2 of these controls to potentially
improve TensorFlow recognition in Freight Frenzy.

Hats off to `rgatkinson <https://github.com/rgatkinson>`__ and
`Windwoes <https://github.com/Windwoes>`__ who developed these 
webcam controls.

Summary
-------

Some webcam controls in the SDK could potentially improve TFOD
recognitions. Exposure, gain and other values could be pre-programmed in
team autonomous OpModes. Itâ€™s also possible to manually enter such
values before a match begins, based on anticipated lighting, starting
position and other game-time factors.

You are encouraged to submit other webcam reports and examples that
worked for you.
