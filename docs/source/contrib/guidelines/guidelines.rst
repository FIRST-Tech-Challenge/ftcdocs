Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Contributors are the lifeblood of the project. We welcome contributions but remind everyone to 
be a :doc:`Gracious Professional </gracious_professionalism/gp>`.

Creating an Issue
------------------

Please start by creating an issue to describe the problem or the feature you would like.
This allows for discussion to happen which may resolve the issue at that stage, or perhaps clarify the request and the work to be done.

There are two types of issues: bugs and feature requests. A bug report is an issue that describes a problem with the 
documentation. A feature request is an issue that describes a new feature that should be added to the documentation. 

Before creating either make sure to check for duplicates. If you find a duplicate, comment on the issue and add your 
input where possible. If possible we would love to see a pull request that fixes the issue. If you are unsure how to fix the issue 
that is perfectly alright. 

Bug Reports
-------------

* A description of the bug
* Expected behavior
* Steps to reproduce the bug (If applicable)
* Screenshots (If applicable)

Feature Requests
------------------

* A description of the feature
* Why you think this feature should be added
* Screenshots (If applicable)

Creating a Pull Request
-----------------------

A Pull Request (PR) is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.
In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
In GitHub, a PR will display the differences between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.

PRs should be made to the `FTC Docs <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs>`_ repository on GitHub. Your 
title should aim to describe the purpose of your PR in a *concise* manner. For more information on creating a PR, see 
`creating a pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_
on GitHub.
We have specific guidance for making changes, start with the :doc:`Change Overview </contrib/tutorials/overview/overview>`.

Colophon
--------

FTC Docs is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ using a `theme <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme>`__ provided by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

Sphinx is a documentation generator.
Sphinx converts reStructuredText files into HTML web pages. 
Read the Docs is a documentation hosting platform and provides the base Sphinx theme for FTC Docs.

The `Dark theme <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs-helper/tree/main/sphinx_rtd_dark_mode_v2>`__ is provided by the FTC Docs development team.

.. We might wish to state what version of Sphinx we use and other version info.
   This is also where we could declare what versions of HTML, XML, CSS we target. Perhaps what browsers we target. 
   (X)HTML, CSS, or usability standards compliance information and links to website validation tests. This used to be a thing, not so much anymore.
   Perhaps that we are WCAG compliant someday.
