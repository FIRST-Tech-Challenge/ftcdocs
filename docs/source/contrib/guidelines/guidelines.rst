Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Contributors are the lifeblood of the project. We welcome contributions but remind everyone to 
be a :doc:`Gracious Professional </gracious_professionalism/gp>`.

Creating a PR
--------------

PRs should be made to the `FTC Docs <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs>`_ repo on GitHub. Your 
title should aim to describe the purpose of your PR in a *concise* manner. For more information on creating a 
PR, see 
`this <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_


Creating an Issue
------------------

There are two types of issues: bugs and feature requests. A bug report is an issue that describes a problem with the 
documentation. A feature request is an issue that describes a new feature that should be added to the documentation. 
Before creating either make sure to check for duplicates. If you find a duplicate, comment on the issue and add your 
input where possible. If possible we would love to see a PR that fixes the issue. If you are unsure how to fix the issue 
that is perfectly alright. 

Bug Reports
-------------

* A description of the bug
* Expected behavior
* Steps to reproduce the bug (If applicable)
* Screenshots (If applicable)

Feature Requests
------------------

* A description of the feature
* Why you think this feature should be added
* Screenshots (If applicable)

Colophon
--------

FTC Docs is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ using a `theme <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme>`__ provided by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

The `Dark theme <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs-helper/tree/main/sphinx_rtd_dark_mode_v2>`__ is provided by the FTC Docs development team.

.. We might wish to state what version of Sphinx we use and other version info.
   This is also where we could declare what versions of HTML, XML, CSS we target. Perhaps what browsers we target. 
   (X)HTML, CSS, or usability standards compliance information and links to website validation tests. This used to be a thing, not so much anymore.
   Perhaps that we are WCAG compliant someday.
