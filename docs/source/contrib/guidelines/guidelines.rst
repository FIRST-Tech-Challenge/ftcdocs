Creating a PR
--------------

PRs should be made to the `FTC Docs <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs>`_ repo on GitHub. Your 
title should aim to desrcribe the purpose of your pr in a *concise* manner. For more information on creating a 
PR, see 
`this <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_


Creating an Issue
------------------

There are two types of issues: bugs and feature requests. A bug report is an issue that describes a problem with the 
documentation. A feature request is an issue that describes a new feature that should be added to the documentation. 
Before creating either make sure to check for duplicates. If you find a duplicate, comment on the issue and add your 
input where possible. If possible we would love to see a PR that fixes the issue. If you are unsure how to fix the issue 
that is perfectly alright.
