============================
.. note::
    This following assumes you have already created a GitHub account. If you have not, please `create one <https://github.com/join>`_

Forking a repository is a simple process. It creates a copy of the repository in your account, and you can make changes to it without affecting the original repository. 
You can also submit a pull request to the original repository to propose changes to the original repository. It also allows you to keep your forked repository up to date with the original repository.

Steps
-----

1. Go to the repository you want to fork. In this case, it is the FTC Docs `repository <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs>`_.
2. Follow the steps outlined `here <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository>`_ to fork the repository.
