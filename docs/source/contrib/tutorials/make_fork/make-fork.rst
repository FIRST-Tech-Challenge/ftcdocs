Forking a repository is a simple process. It creates a copy of the repository in your account, and you can make changes to it without affecting the original repository. 
You can also submit a pull request to the original repository to propose changes to the original repository. It also allows you to easily keep your forked repository up to date with the original repository.

Steps
-----

1. Go to the repository you want to fork. In this case, it is the FTC Docs `repository <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs>`_.
