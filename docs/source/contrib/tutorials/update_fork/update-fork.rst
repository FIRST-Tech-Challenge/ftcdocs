Updating Fork
==============

Your fork, while linked to the original repository, does not serve as a mirror. 
When changes are made "upstream" (in the original repository), you will need to update your 
fork to reflect these changes. You will want to do this **before** you start working on a new feature or bug fix.

Steps
-----

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub

2. Follow the steps outlined in the 
   `GitHub Documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-web-ui>`_ to update your fork.
