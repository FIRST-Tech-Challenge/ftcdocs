Setting Up Your Development Environment (One Time Only)
=======================================================

FTC Docs has a few dependencies that you'll need to install before you can start developing. 
Full build features are only available on Linux. 
Windows users can still build the site, but will not be able to use the full feature set. For most 
Windows users this will not be a problem. This will only affect those adding features to PDF generation.

.. note:: If you are using codespaces, you can skip this step. Codespaces comes with all the dependencies you need.

Steps
-----

1. Install Python 3.8 or later. You can download it from the `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
2. Install the latest version of `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
3. Install Git from the `Git website <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.
4. Install the lastest version of `VS Code  <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_.

.. warning:: In some cases, you may need to restart your computer after installing these dependencies for the changes to take effect.

5. Open VS Code
