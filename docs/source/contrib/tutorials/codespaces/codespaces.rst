What is Codespaces?
-------------------

Codespaces is a cloud-hosted development environment that you can access from anywhere. 
It comes with a pre-configured Visual Studio Code environment and a containerized runtime that matches your development environment. 
You can use Codespaces to develop in a browser, or by using the Visual Studio Code Remote - Codespaces 
extension in your local Visual Studio Code instance. 

Why use Codespaces?
-------------------

Codespaces is a great way to develop in a consistent environment, no matter where you are. It 
also allows you to develop on a device that might not have the resources to run your development 
environment locally. It also allows you to sidestep the need to install and configure your 
development environment on a new machine.

Who should use Codespaces?
---------------------------

Codespaces is our recommended development environment for all developers. It is especially 
useful for developers who need to work on multiple machines, or who are not comfortable with 
setting up their development environment and the troubleshooting that comes with it.

Downside of Codespaces
----------------------

Codespaces is a paid service, and you will be billed for the resources you use. However, 
GitHub currently offers GitHub Free tier users **120 Core hours** and GitHub Pro tier users **180 
Core hours** per month for free. To learn more about Codespaces pricing, visit
